<h2 class="nobreak">INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Once</span> upon a time there was a little girl
named Margaret, and she wanted to
cook, so she went into the kitchen and
tried and tried, but she could not
understand the cookery books, and she
made dreadful messes, and spoiled her
frocks, and burned her fingers till she
cried and cried.</p>

<p>One day she went to her grandmother
and her mother and her Pretty Aunt
and her Other Aunt, who were all sitting
sewing, and asked them to tell her
about cooking.</p>

<p>“What is a roux,” she said, “and
what’s a mousse and what’s an entrée?
What are timbales and sautés and
ingredients, and how do you mix them
and how long do you bake them?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">[viii]</span>
Won’t somebody please tell me all
about it?”</p>

<p>And her Pretty Aunt said, “See the
flour all over that new frock!” and her
mother said, “Dear child, you are not
old enough to cook yet”; and her
grandmother said, “Just wait a year
or two, and I’ll teach you myself”;
and her Other Aunt said, “Some day
you shall go to the cookery-school and
learn everything; you know little girls
can’t cook.”</p>

<p>But Margaret said, “I don’t want to
wait till I’m big; I want to cook now;
and I don’t want to do cookery-school
cooking, but little girl cooking, all by
myself.”</p>

<p>So she kept on trying to learn, but
she burned her fingers and spoiled her
dresses worse than ever, and her messes
were so bad they had to be thrown
away, every one of them; and she cried
and cried. And then one day her
grandmother said, “It’s a shame that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">[ix]</span>
child should not learn to cook if she
really wants to so much”; and her
mother said, “Yes, it is a shame, and
she shall learn! Let’s get her a small
table and some tins and aprons, and
make her a little cookery-book all her
own, out of the old ones we wrote for
ourselves long ago—just the plain, easy
things anybody can make.” And both
her aunts said, “Do! We will help,
and perhaps we might put in just a few
cookery-school things beside.”</p>

<p>It was not long after this that Margaret
had a birthday, and she was taken
to the kitchen to get her presents, which
she thought the funniest thing in the
world. There they all were, in the
middle of the room: first her father’s
present, a little table with a white oil-cloth
cover and castors, which would
push right under the big table when it
was not being used. Over a chair her
grandmother’s present, three nice gingham
aprons, with sleeves and ruffled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span>
bibs. On the little table the presents
of the aunties, shiny new tins and
saucepans, and cups to measure with,
and spoons, and a toasting-fork, and ever
so many things; and then on one corner
of the table, all by itself, was her
mother’s present, her own little cookery-book,
with her own name on it, and that
was best of all.</p>

<p>When Margaret had looked at everything,
she set out in a row the big bowl
and the middle-sized bowl and the little
wee bowl, and put the scalloped patty-pans
round them, and the real egg-beater
in front of all, just like a picture,
and then she read a page in her cookery-book,
and began to believe it was all
true. So she danced for joy, and put
on a gingham apron and began to cook
that very minute, and before another
birthday she had cooked every single
thing in the book.</p>

<p>This is Margaret’s cookery-book.</p>

<h4>PORRIDGE</h4>

<p>1 quart of boiling water.<br>
4 tablespoonfuls of oatmeal.<br>
1 teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>When you are going to make porridge,
always begin to cook it the night
before. Put a quart of boiling water
in the outside of a double saucepan,
and another quart in the inside, and in
this last mix the salt and oatmeal.
Put the saucepan on the back of the
kitchen range, where it will hardly cook
at all, and let it stand all night. If the
fire is to go out, put it on so that it will
cook for two hours first. In the morning,
if the water in the outside of the
saucepan is cold, fill it up with hot, and
boil hard for an hour without stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
the mixture. Then turn it out in a hot
dish, and send it to the table with a
jug of cream.</p>

<h4>BOILED RICE</h4>

<p>1 cup of rice.<br>
2 cups of boiling water.<br>
1 teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Pick the rice over, taking out all the
bits of brown husk; fill the outside of
a porridge saucepan with hot water,
and put in the rice, salt, and water, and
cook for forty minutes, but do not stir
it. Then take off the cover from the
saucepan, and very gently, without
stirring, turn over the rice with a fork;
put the dish in the oven without the
cover, and let it stand and dry for ten
minutes. Then turn it from the saucepan
into a hot dish, and put a cover
on and serve with cream.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span></p>

<h4>RICE CROQUETTES</h4>

<p>1 cup of milk.<br>
Yolk of 1 egg.<br>
¼ cup of rice.<br>
1 large tablespoonful of powdered sugar.<br>
Small half-teaspoonful of salt.<br>
½ cup of raisins and currants, mixed.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Wash the rice and put it in a double
saucepan with the milk, salt, and sugar
and cook till very thick; beat the
yolks of the eggs and stir into the rice,
and beat till smooth. Sprinkle the
washed raisins and currants with flour,
and roll them in it and mix these in,
and last the vanilla. Turn out on a
plate, and let all get very cold. Then
make into pyramids, dip in the yolk of
an egg mixed with a tablespoonful of
water, and then into sifted bread-crumbs,
and fry in a deep saucepan of boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
fat, using a wire basket. As you take
these from the fat, put them on paper
in the oven with the door open. When
all are done, put them on a hot plate
and sift powdered sugar over them, and
put a bit of red jelly on top of each.
This is also a nice sweet for luncheon.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">EGGS</h3>

<h4>TO BOIL EGGS</h4>

<p>When the water boils, allow three and
a half minutes for a lightly boiled egg,
four minutes for better done, and five
minutes for hard-boiled.</p>

<h4>POACHED EGGS</h4>

<p>Take a pan which is not more than
three inches deep, and put in as many
muffin-rings as you wish to cook eggs.
Pour in boiling water till the rings are
half covered, and scatter half a teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of salt in the water. Let it
boil up once, and then draw the pan
to the edge of the stove, where the
water will not boil again. Take a cup,
break one egg in it, and gently slide this
into a ring, and so on till all are full.
While they are cooking, take some toast
and cut it into round pieces with the
biscuit-cutter, then butter them. When
the eggs have cooked ten minutes, take
a slice and slip it under one egg with its
ring, and lift the two together on to a
piece of toast, and then take off the
ring; and so on with all the eggs.
Shake a very little salt and pepper over
the dish, and put parsley round the
edge. Sometimes a little chopped parsley
is nice to put over the eggs, too.</p>

<h4>POACHED EGGS WITH WHITE SAUCE</h4>

<p>Poach what number of eggs you
require. Place on rounds of buttered<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>
toast. Have ready a nice creamy
sauce as follows:</p>

<p>1 tablespoonful of butter; when
melted put in 1 oz. of flour. Mix
both together, add enough milk to the
thickness you require, stirring it all the
time. A little cream added greatly
improves it; serve with chopped ham,
tongue, or parsley sprinkled over the
eggs.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS</h4>

<p>4 eggs.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of milk.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Put the eggs in a bowl and stir till
they are well mixed; add the milk and
salt. Make the frying-pan very hot,
and put 1 oz. of butter in it; when it
melts, stir it well from side to side, till
the bottom of the pan is covered. Put
in the eggs, and stir them, scraping
them off the bottom of the pan until<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
they begin to get a little firm; then
draw the pan to the edge of the stove,
and scrape up from the bottom all the
time till the whole looks alike, creamy
and firm, but not hard. Put them in a
hot, covered dish.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH PARSLEY</h4>

<p>Chop enough parsley to make a teaspoonful,
and mince half as much onion.
Put the onion in the butter when you
heat the pan, and cook the eggs in it;
when you are nearly ready to take the
eggs off the fire, put in the parsley.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>After Margaret had learned how to
make these perfectly, she began to mix
other things with the eggs.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH TOMATO</h4>

<p>When Margaret had a few tomatoes
she would take them, add a half-teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
of salt, two shakes of pepper,
and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley,
and simmer it all on the fire for five
minutes; then she would cook half a
teaspoonful of minced onion in the
butter in the hot frying-pan as before,
and turn in the eggs, and when they
were beginning to grow firm put in the
tomato. This made a very nice breakfast
dish.</p>

<h4>SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH CHICKEN</h4>

<p>Chop fine a cup of cold chicken, or
any light-coloured meat, such as veal,
and heat it with a tablespoonful of
water, a half-teaspoonful of salt, two
shakes of pepper, and a teaspoonful of
chopped parsley. Cook a half-teaspoonful
of minced onion in the butter you
put in the hot frying-pan, and turn in
the eggs, and when they set, mix in the
chicken.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>Sometimes Margaret used tomato,
as in the previous recipe, and the
chicken in the eggs, when she wanted to
make a large dish.</p>

<h4>EGGS BALDWIN</h4>

<p>Boil 5 or 6 eggs hard. Put them
into cold water, then shell them, make
a white sauce the same as already described
on page 8, with pepper and salt
to taste. Remove the yolk from the
whites, cut up the whites in slices, and
put into the sauce to boil up for a
minute. Pass the yolks through a wire
sieve, put the sauce and egg mixture
into a dish, and decorate the top with
the yolk and some chopped parsley.</p>

<h4>CREAMED EGGS IN BAKING-DISHES</h4>

<p>Cut six hard-boiled eggs into bits,
mix with a cup of white sauce, and put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
in small baking-dishes which you have
buttered. Cover over with fine, sifted
bread-crumbs, and dot with bits of
butter, about four to each dish, and
brown in the oven. Stick a bit of
parsley in the top of each, and put each
dish on a plate, to serve.</p>

<h4>BIRDS’ NESTS</h4>

<p>Sometimes, when she wanted something
very pretty for breakfast, Margaret
used this recipe:</p>

<p>Break six eggs, putting the whites
together in one large bowl, and the
yolks into six cups on the kitchen table.
Beat the whites till they are stiff, putting
in half a teaspoonful of salt afterwards.
Divide the whites, putting them into
six patty-pans, or small baking-dishes.
Make a little hole or nest in the middle
of each, and slip one yolk carefully from
the cup into the place. Sprinkle a little<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>
salt and pepper over them, and put a
bit of butter on top, and put the dishes
into a pan and set in the oven till the
egg-whites are a little brown.</p>

<h4>OMELETTE</h4>

<p>Making an omelette seems rather a
difficult thing for a little girl, but
Margaret made hers in a very easy way.
Her recipe said:</p>

<p>Break four eggs separately. Beat
the whites till they are stiff, and then
wash and wipe dry the egg-beater, and
beat the yolks till they foam, and then
put in half a teaspoonful of salt. Pour
the yolks over the whites, and mix
gently with a large spoon. Have a
frying-pan hot, with a piece of butter
melted in it, and spread the butter over
the whole surface; pour the eggs on
and let them cook for a moment. Then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>
take a kitchen palette-knife and slip
under an edge, and look to see if the
middle is getting brown, because the
colour comes there first. When it is
a nice even colour, slip the knife well
under, and turn the omelette half over,
covering one part with the other, and
then slip the whole off on to a hot plate.</p>

<p>The cook had to show Margaret how to
manage this the first time, but after
that she could do it alone.</p>

<h4>OMELETTE WITH MUSHROOMS</h4>

<p>Take a few mushrooms or a bottle of
<i>champignons</i>, and slice half of them into
thin pieces. Make a cup of very rich
white sauce, using cream instead of
milk, and cook the mushrooms in it
for one minute. Make the omelette as
before, and cover with the sauce when
you turn it over.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span></p>

<h4>EGGS IN CASES</h4>

<p>Butter some ramekin cases (china or
paper) and put a small piece of butter
and a pinch of chopped parsley, pepper
and salt, and break an egg carefully
into each case; add a tablespoonful of
cream and a few browned bread-crumbs.
Bake about five minutes.</p>

<h4>EGGS WITH CHEESE</h4>

<p>6 eggs.<br>
2 full tablespoonfuls Parmesan cheese.<br>
½ teaspoonful salt.<br>
Pinch of red pepper.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs without separating till
light and foamy, and then add the
cheese, salt, and pepper. Put a tablespoonful
of butter in the frying-pan, and
when it is hot put in the eggs, and stir
till smooth and firm. Serve on small
pieces of buttered toast.</p>

<p>Parmesan cheese is very nice to use<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span>
in cooking; it comes in bottles, all
ready grated to use.</p>

<h4>FRIED EGGS AND BACON</h4>

<p>Take some bacon and put in a hot
frying-pan, and cook till it crisps.
Then lift it out on a hot dish and put
in the oven. Break six eggs in separate
cups, and slide them carefully into the
fat left in the pan, and let them cook
till they are rather firm and the bottom
is brown. Then take a strainer and
take them out carefully, and put in the
middle of the dish, and arrange the
bacon all around, with parsley on the
edge.</p>

<h4>HAM AND EGGS, MOULDED</h4>

<p>Take small, deep tins, such as are
used for timbales, and butter them.
Make one cup of white sauce; take a
cup of cold boiled ham which has been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
put through the mincing-machine, and
mix with a tablespoonful of white sauce
and one egg, slightly beaten. Press this
like a lining into the tins, and then
gently drop a raw egg in the centre of
each. Stand them in a pan of boiling
water in the oven till the eggs are firm—about
ten minutes—and turn out on
a round dish. Put round them the
rest of the white sauce. You can stand
the little moulds on circles of toast if
you wish.</p>

<p>This recipe was given Margaret by her
Pretty Aunt, who got it at the cookery-school;
it sounded harder than it really
was, and after trying it once Margaret
often used it.</p>

<h4>SCOTCH EGGS</h4>

<p>3 hard-boiled eggs.<br>
½ lb. of sausages.<br>
1 raw egg.<br>
Bread-crumbs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>Shell the eggs and put them in cold
water for a few minutes, then take
out and dry them. Roll them out in
flour, then coat each over with sausage
meat, keeping the shape. Next break
an egg on a plate, brush the eggs over
with the raw egg and roll them in bread-crumbs,
and fry in the hot fat till a
golden brown. To be served on fried
bread.</p>

<h4>DEVILLED EGGS</h4>

<p>Fry four eggs lightly, then trim them
neatly with a round cutter and dish
them up. Pour over them the following,
put together in a stewpan: 1 oz. of
butter, 1 tablespoonful cream, 1 teaspoonful
of mustard, 1 teaspoonful of
flour, 1 tablespoonful chutney, 1 teaspoonful
Worcester sauce, 4 tablespoonfuls
stock. Stir till it comes thick, and
pour over the eggs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">FISH</h3>

<p>One day some little fish came home
from market, and Margaret felt sure
they must be meant for her to cook.
They were called smelts, and, on looking,
she found a recipe for cooking them,
just as she had expected.</p>

<h4>FRIED SMELTS</h4>

<p>Put a deep kettle on the fire, with two
cups of lard in it, to get very hot. Wipe
each smelt inside and out with a clean
wet cloth, and then with a dry one.
Have a saucer of flour mixed with a
teaspoonful of salt, and another saucer
of milk. Put the tail of each smelt
through its gills—that is, the opening
near its mouth. Then roll the smelts
first in milk and then in flour, and shake
off any lumps. Throw a bit of bread
into the fat in the kettle, and see if it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
turns brown quickly; it does if the fat
is hot enough, but if not you must wait.
Put four smelts in the wire basket, and
stand it in the fat, so that the fish are
entirely covered, for only half a minute,
or till you can count thirty. As you
take them out of the kettle, lay them
on heavy brown paper in a pan in the
oven, to drain and keep hot, and leave
the door open till all are done. Lay a
folded napkin on a long, narrow dish,
and arrange the fishes in a row, with
slices of lemon and parsley on the sides.</p>

<h4>FISH CAKES</h4>

<p>2 eggs, bread-crumbs, and cold fish.</p>

<p>They are made from any cold fish, by
making a nice white sauce, very thick.
Take all the fish from the bones and
mash up with salt and pepper, then put
it into the sauce. Stir all up together,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>
turn out in a dish, and let it get quite
cold and hard.</p>

<p>Have ready your boiling fat; roll the
fish mixture in your hands the shape
you want the cakes; beat up 2 eggs and
brush them over with the eggs and place
in the bread-crumbs. This must be
done twice, as then the fish cakes will
not burst. Cook for five minutes.</p>

<h4>SCALLOPED FISH</h4>

<p>The fish is done just as the fish
cakes are, in sauce, but it is turned out
into a dish or pie-dish, which must be
buttered, and a layer of bread-crumbs
sprinkled over, with bits of butter put on
the top. Place in an oven till it browns
on the top.</p>

<h4>PICKLED HERRINGS OR MACKEREL</h4>

<p>Split open four or five herrings. Wash
them and remove the back-bone. Roll<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>
up from the head end, with their roes
inside. Place in a dish, cover them
with vinegar, two bay-leaves, and a few
peppercorns and a few slices of onions;
put in the oven with a plate over the
dish and cook till the onion is done;
turn them out in any dish and pour the
liquor over them.</p>

<h4>DRIED HADDOCK</h4>

<p>Place your haddock in a baking-tin
and cover it with half milk and half
water. If there is no milk use only
water. Put a plate or dish over the
top and put in the oven until it is
done. Do not boil it over the fire, as
you lose half the flavour.</p>

<h4>SCOTCH DRIED HADDOCK</h4>

<p>Hold the haddock in front of the fire
till it is warm, then remove the skin at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>
the back, beginning at the tail. Put it
into a grill and let it cook in front of
the fire for five or six minutes. Put
butter and pepper; serve very hot.</p>

<h4>FRIED PLAICE OR SOLE</h4>

<p>Have the plaice filleted. Wash and
dry it, then brush it over with raw eggs
and place it in bread-crumbs. Have
your frying fat boiling and put the
plaice in to cook for five minutes. Take
out and put on kitchen paper to drain
the fat off. Serve on hot dish, with fish
paper under, and decorate with parsley.</p>

<h4>FILLETS OF SOLES WITH WHITE
WINE SAUCE</h4>

<p>Boil the fillets of soles till done, then
make the white sauce. Add a sherry
glass of wine, then put the fillets into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
the sauce. Allow them to simmer two
or three minutes, then add the yolk of
an egg to the sauce and serve.</p>

<h4>HOW TO GRILL ANY FISH FOR
BREAKFAST</h4>

<p>Split them open. Wash and dry any
fish, such as herrings, mackerel, fresh
haddock; kippers are also done this
way. Place in the grill and do in front
of the fire; put butter and pepper on
to taste. They will take about ten
minutes.</p>

<h4>HOW TO BOIL FISH</h4>

<p>Rub the skin of the fish with lemon
and put salt in water. Wash the fish
first and place it in the fish-kettle with
enough water to well cover it. Let it
come up to the boil and afterwards let
it gently simmer until cooked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span></p>

<h4>FRIED BACON</h4>

<p>Margaret’s mother believed there was
only one very nice way to cook bacon.
It was like this: Slice the bacon very,
very thin, and cut off the rind. Put
the slices in a hot frying-pan for about
three minutes. When both sides are
cooked, lay it on a hot dish.</p>

<h4>GRILLED CHOPS</h4>

<p>Rub the grill with some of the fat, so
that the chops will not stick. Lay in
the chops and put over a clear, red fire
without flame, and toast one side first
and then the other; do this till they are
brown. Lay on a hot dish, and dust
both sides with salt and a tiny bit of
pepper. Put bits of lemon and parsley
round, and send to the table very
hot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span></p>

<h4>FRIED CHOPS</h4>

<p>If the fire is not clear, so that you
cannot grill the chops, you must fry
them. Take a frying-pan and make it
very hot indeed; then lay in the chops
and cook one side very quickly, and
then the other, and after that let them
cook more slowly. When they are
done—you can tell by picking open a
little place in one with a fork and looking
in the inside—put them on a dish
as before, with pepper and salt. If
they are at all greasy, put on kitchen
paper in the oven first, to drain, leaving
the door of the oven open. Be careful
not to let them get cold.</p>

<h4>LIVER AND BACON</h4>

<p>Buy half a pound of calf’s liver and
half a pound of bacon. Cut the liver in
thin slices and pour boiling water over<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
it, and then wipe each slice dry. Slice
the bacon very thin and cut off the
rind; put this in a hot frying-pan and
cook very quickly, turning it once or
twice. Just as soon as it is brown take
it out and lay it on a dish. Take a
saucer of flour and mix in it a teaspoonful
of salt and a very little pepper; dip
the slices of liver in this, one at a time,
and shake them free of lumps. Lay
them in the hot fat of the bacon in the
pan and fry till brown. Put on a hot
dish, and then put one slice of bacon on
each slice of liver. Put parsley all
round, and sometimes use slices of
lemon, too, for a change.</p>

<h4>BACHELOR BREAKFAST</h4>

<p>Two slices of bacon fried. Place on
them a fried egg and on the top a cooked
tomato which has been fried in a little
butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span></p>

<h4>GRILLED STEAK</h4>

<p>See that the fire is clear and red,
without flames. Trim off most of the
fat from the steak, and rub the wires
of the grill with it and heat it over the
coals. Then put in the meat and turn
over and over as it cooks, and be careful
not to let it get burnt. When brown,
put it on a hot dish, dust over with
salt and a very little pepper, and dot it
with tiny lumps of butter. Put parsley
round. Steak ought to be pink inside;
not brown and not red. Put a
fork in as you did with the chops, and
twist in a little, and you can see when
it gets the right colour.</p>

<h4>VEAL CUTLET</h4>

<p>Dust the meat over with salt, pepper,
and flour. Put a tablespoonful of
dripping in a hot frying-pan, and let it
heat till it smokes a little. Lay the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
meat in and turn it over twice as it
cooks, until it is brown, for veal cutlets
must not be eaten red or pink inside.
Put in a hot oven and cover it up while
you make the gravy, by putting one
tablespoonful of flour into the hot fat
in the pan, stirring it till it is brown.
Then put in a cup of boiling water, half
a teaspoonful of salt, and a very little
pepper; put this through the strainer,
pressing it with a spoon, and pour over
the meat. Put parsley round the cutlet,
and send hot to the table.</p>

<p>Margaret’s father said he could not
possibly manage without potatoes for
breakfast, so sometimes Margaret made
something nice out of the cold potatoes
she found in the larder.</p>

<h4>CREAMED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Cut cold boiled potatoes into pieces as
large as the end of your finger; put<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
them into a pan on the back of the
stove, with enough milk to cover them,
and let them stand till they have drunk
up all the milk; perhaps they will
slowly cook a little as they do this, but
that will do no harm. In another
saucepan, or in the frying-pan, put a
tablespoonful of butter, and when it
bubbles put in a tablespoonful of flour,
and stir till they melt together; then
put in two cups of hot milk, and stir till
it is all smooth. Put in one teaspoonful
of salt, and lastly the potatoes, but
stir them only once while they cook, for
fear of breaking them. Add one teaspoonful
of chopped parsley, and put
them in a hot covered dish. You can
make another sort of potatoes when you
have finished creaming them in this
way, by putting a layer of them in a
deep buttered baking-pan, with a layer
of white sauce over the top, and bread-crumbs
and bits of butter for a crust.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>
Brown well in a hot oven. When you
do this, remember to make the sauce
with three cups of milk and two tablespoonfuls
of flour and two of butter, and
then you will have enough for everything.</p>

<h4>HASHED BROWNED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Chop four cold potatoes fine, and add
one teaspoonful of salt and a very little
pepper. Put a tablespoonful of butter
in the frying-pan, and turn it so that it
runs all over; when it bubbles put in the
potatoes, and smooth them evenly over
the pan. Cook till they are brown and
crusty on the bottom; then put in a
teaspoonful of chopped parsley, and
fold over like an omelette.</p>

<h4>CHIPPED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Wash and peel four potatoes and cut
them into thin pieces. Heat two cups<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
of lard very hot, till when you drop in
a bit of bread it browns at once. Wipe
the potatoes dry and drop in a handful.
Have a slice ready, and as soon as they
brown take them out and lay on brown
paper in the oven, and put in another
handful.</p>

<h4>POTATO CAKES</h4>

<p>Take two cups of mashed potato, and
mix well with the beaten yolk of one
egg, and make into small flat cakes;
dip each into flour. Heat two tablespoonfuls
of nice dripping, and when
it is hot lay in the cakes and brown,
turning each with the slice as it gets
crusty on the bottom.</p>

<h4>TO KEEP FRYING FAT</h4>

<p>The fat can be used to fry in a great
many times if strained after using, and
put in a clean jar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span></p>

<p>How to know when fat is boiling:
Drop a few bread-crumbs in the
fat. They should turn brown at
once.</p>

<h4>BUTTERED TOAST</h4>

<p>Toast is very difficult for grown-up
people to make, because they have
made it wrong all their lives, but it is
easy for little girls to learn to make,
because they can make it right from the
first.</p>

<p>Cut bread that is at least two days
old into slices a third of an inch thick.
Be sure the fire is red, without any
flames. Take the toasting-fork and
move the slices of bread backwards
and forwards across the coals, but do
not let them brown; do both sides
this way, and then brown first one and
then the other afterward. Trim off<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
the edges, butter a little quickly, and
send to the table hot.</p>

<h4>BAKING-POWDER BISCUIT</h4>

<p>Margaret’s Other Aunt said little
girls could never, never make biscuits,
but this little girl really did, in this
way:</p>

<p>1 pint of sifted flour.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
4 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.<br>
¾ cup of milk.<br>
1 tablespoonful of butter.</p>

<p>Put the salt and baking-powder in
the flour and sift well, and then rub the
butter in with a spoon. Little by little
put in the milk, mixing all the time, and
then lift out the dough on a floured
board and roll it out lightly, just once,
till it is one inch thick. Flour your
hands and mould the little balls as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
quickly as you can, and put them close
together in a shallow pan that has had
a little flour shaken over the bottom,
and bake in a hot oven about twenty
minutes, or till the biscuits are brown.
If you handle the dough much, the
biscuits will be tough, so you must work
fast.</p>

<h4>MUFFINS</h4>

<p>2 cups of sifted flour.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
1 cup of milk.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
1 large teaspoonful of melted butter.</p>

<p>Mix the flour, salt, and baking-powder,
and sift. Beat the yolks of
the eggs, put in the butter with them
and the milk, then the flour, and last
the stiff whites of the eggs. Have the
muffin-tins hot, pour in the batter, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>
bake fifteen or twenty minutes. These
must be eaten at once, or they will
fall.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>There was one little recipe in Margaret’s
book which she thought must
be meant for the smallest girl who ever
tried to cook, it was so easy. But the
little biscuits were good enough for
grown people to like. This was it:</p>

<h4>CREAM CRACKERS</h4>

<p>Quarter-pound of flour, yolks of two
eggs; beat them well with a quarter
of a pint of cream and pinch of salt.
Stir into the flour, roll out very thin,
cut into any shape with a knife, prick
with a fork, and bake a few at a time
in a good oven. They must be straw
colour. In a good oven they should
take five minutes. Put on a sieve till
cold.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span></p>

<h4>GRIDDLE-CAKES</h4>

<p>2 eggs.<br>
1 cup of milk.<br>
1½cups of flour.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Put the eggs in a bowl without
separating them, and beat them with
a spoon till light. Put in the milk,
then the flour mixed with the salt,
and last the baking-powder all alone.
Bake on a hot, buttered griddle.
This recipe makes delicious cakes,
especially if eaten with sugar and
thick cream.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Last of all the things Margaret learned
to make for breakfast came coffee, and
this she could make in two ways; sometimes
she made it this first way, and
sometimes the other, which is called
French coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span></p>

<h4>COFFEE</h4>

<p>First be sure your coffee-pot is
shining clean; look in the spout and in
all the cracks, and wipe them out carefully,
for you cannot make good coffee
except in a perfectly clean pot. Then
get three heaped tablespoonfuls of ground
coffee, and mix in one tablespoonful of
cold water. Pour in one quart of boiling
water, and let it boil up once. Then stir
down the grounds which come to the
top, put in two tablespoonfuls of cold
water, and let it stand for a minute on
the back of the stove, and then strain
it into the silver pot for the table. This
pot must be made very hot, by filling
it with boiling water and letting it stand
on the kitchen table while the coffee is
boiling. If this recipe makes the coffee
stronger than the family like it, take
less coffee, and if it is not strong enough,
take more coffee.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span></p>

<h4>FRENCH COFFEE</h4>

<p>Get one of the pots which are made
so that the coffee will drip through;
put three tablespoonfuls of very finely
powdered coffee in this, and pour in a
quart of boiling water. When it has
all dripped through, it is ready to put
in the hot silver pot.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span></p>

<p>So many things in this part of Margaret’s
book called for white sauce, or
cream sauce, that the recipe for that
came first of all.</p>

<h4>WHITE OR CREAM SAUCE</h4>

<p>1 tablespoonful of butter.<br>
1 tablespoonful of flour.<br>
1 cup hot milk or cream.<br>
⅓ teaspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Melt the butter, and when it bubbles
put in the flour, shaking the saucepan
as you do so, and rub till smooth. Put
in the hot milk, a little at a time, and
stir and cook without boiling till all is
smooth and free from lumps. Add the
salt, and, if you choose, a little pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>Cream sauce is made exactly as is
white sauce, but cream is used in place
of milk. What is called thick white
sauce is made by taking two tablespoonfuls
of butter and two of flour, and only
one cup of milk.</p>

<h4>CREAMED OYSTERS</h4>

<p>1 pint of oysters.<br>
1 large cup of cream sauce.</p>

<p>Make the sauce of cream if you have
it, and if not use a very heaping tablespoonful
of butter in the white sauce.
Keep this hot.</p>

<p>Drain off the oyster juice and wash
the oysters by holding them under the
cold-water tap. Strain the juice and
put the oysters back in it, and put them
on the fire and let them just simmer till
the edges of the oysters curl; then drain
them from the juice again and drop
them in the sauce, and add a little more<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
salt (celery-salt is nice to use if you have
it), and just a tiny bit of cayenne pepper.
You can serve the oysters on squares of
buttered toast, or put them in a large
dish, with sifted bread-crumbs over the
top and tiny bits of butter, and brown
in the oven. Or you can put them in
small dishes as they are, and put a
sprig of parsley in each dish.</p>

<h4>PANNED OYSTERS</h4>

<p>Take the oysters from their juice,
strain it, wash the oysters, and put
them back in it. Put them in a saucepan
with a little salt—about half a teaspoonful
to a pint of oysters—and a
little pepper, and a piece of butter as
large as the end of your thumb. Let
them simmer till the edges curl, just as
before, and put them on squares of hot
buttered toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

<h4>PIGS IN BLANKETS</h4>

<p>These were great fun to make, and
Margaret often begged to get them
ready for company.</p>

<p>15 large oysters.<br>
15 very thin slices of bacon.</p>

<p>Sprinkle each oyster with a very
little salt and pepper. Trim the rind
from the bacon and wrap each oyster
in one slice, pinning this “blanket”
tightly on the back with a tiny Japanese
wooden toothpick. Have ready a hot
frying-pan, and lay in five oysters, and
cook till the bacon is brown and the
edges of the oysters curl, turning each
over once. Put these on a hot plate in
the oven with the door open, and cook
five more, and so on. Put them on
a long, narrow dish, with slices of
lemon and sprigs of parsley round. Or
you can put each one on a strip of toast
which you have dipped in the gravy in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
the pan; this is the better way. This
dish must be eaten very hot, or it will
not be good.</p>

<h4>CREAMED FISH</h4>

<p>2 cups of cold fish.<br>
1 cup of white sauce.</p>

<p>Pick any cold fish left from dinner
into even bits, taking out all the bones
and skin, and mix with the hot white
sauce. Stir until smooth, and add a
small half-teaspoonful of salt, two shakes
of pepper, and sometimes a half-teaspoonful
of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>You can put this in a buttered baking-dish
and cover the top with crumbs
and bits of butter, and brown in the
oven, or you can put it in small dishes
and brown also, or you can serve it just
as it is, in little dishes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span></p>

<h4>CREAMED LOBSTER</h4>

<p>1 lobster, or the meat from 1 tin.<br>
1 large cup of white or cream sauce.</p>

<p>Take the lobster out of the shell and
clean it; the cook will have to show
you how the first time. Or, if you are
using tinned lobster, pour away all the
juice and pick out the bits of shell, and
find the black string which is apt to be
there, and throw it away. Cut the
meat in pieces as large as the end of
your finger, and heat it in the sauce till
it steams. Put in a small half-teaspoonful
of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and
a squeeze of lemon. Do not put this
in a large dish, but in small ones, buttered
well, and serve at once. Stand
a little claw up in each dish.</p>

<h4>DRESSED CRAB</h4>

<p>Crack all the claws of the crab, and
pick out all the fish into a basin. Take<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
all the yellow part out of the body of
the crab and mix it with the other.
Mix together one teaspoonful of mustard
in a quarter-pint of salad oil, one
tablespoonful of vinegar, and two tablespoonfuls
of cream; salt and pepper to
taste. Scrape and wash the body shell
of the crab, then put in the crab which
has been mixed in the sauce; pile it up,
put it on a dish, and serve with parsley
round it.</p>

<h4>HOT CRAB</h4>

<p>Buy a very nice, fresh crab. A very
delicious dish is made by mixing a
cup of rich cream sauce with the
crab meat, seasoning it well with
salt and pepper, and putting in the
crab-shells; cover with crumbs, dot
with butter, and brown in the oven.
This is a nice thing to have for
luncheon when there are visitors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span></p>

<h4>CREAMED CHICKEN OR TURKEY</h4>

<p>2 cups of cold chicken.<br>
1 large cup of white or creamed sauce.<br>
½ teaspoonful of chopped parsley.<br>
Salt and pepper.</p>

<p>Pick the chicken or turkey off the
bones and cut into small bits before you
measure it. Heat it in the sauce till
very hot, but do not let it boil, and add
the seasoning: about half a teaspoonful
of salt, and a tiny bit of cayenne, or
as much celery-salt in the place of the
common kind. Put in a large buttered
dish and serve, or in small dishes, either
with crumbs on top or not.</p>

<h4>SCALLOPED EGGS</h4>

<p>6 hard-boiled eggs.<br>
1 cup cream or white sauce.<br>
1 cup fine bread-crumbs.<br>
Salt and pepper.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>Cook the eggs twenty minutes, and
while they are cooking make the white
sauce, and butter one large or six small
dishes. Peel the eggs and cut them
into bits as large as the end of your
finger. Put a layer of bread-crumbs on
the bottom of the dish; then a layer of
egg; then a sprinkling of salt, pepper,
and bits of butter; then a layer of white
sauce. Then more crumbs, egg, and
seasoning, till the dish is full, with
crumbs on top. Put bits of butter over
all, and brown in the oven.</p>

<h4>EGGS IN DOUBLE CREAM</h4>

<p>This is a recipe Margaret’s Pretty
Aunt got in Paris, and it is a very nice
one. Have half a pint of very thick
cream—the kind you use to whip; the
French call this double cream. Cook
six eggs hard and cut them into bits.
Butter a baking-dish, or small dishes,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
and put in a layer of egg, then a layer of
cream, then a sprinkling of salt, and
one of paprika, which is sweet red pepper.
Put one thin layer of fine, sifted
crumbs on top with butter, and brown
in the oven. Or you can put the eggs
and cream together and heat them, and
serve on thin pieces of buttered toast,
with one extra egg put through the
sieve over the whole.</p>

<h4>CREAMED EGGS ON TOAST</h4>

<p>Make small pieces of nice toast and
dip each one in white sauce. Boil hard
four eggs, and cut in even slices and
cover the toast, and then spread the
rest of the white sauce over all in a
thin layer.</p>

<h4>EGGS IN BEDS</h4>

<p>Chop a cupful of nice cold meat, and
season with a little salt, pepper, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>
chopped parsley. Add enough stock or
hot water just to wet it, and cook till
rather dry. Put this in buttered baking-dishes,
filling each half-full, and on
top of each gently slip from a cup one
egg. Sprinkle over with salt and pepper,
and put in the oven till firm.</p>

<h4>COTTAGE PIE</h4>

<p>This was a dish Margaret used to
make on washing-day and house-cleaning-day,
and such times when everybody
was busy and no one wanted to
stop and go to market to buy anything
for luncheon.</p>

<p>Put one ounce of butter into a saucepan,
and when melted add a tablespoonful
of flour, and when mixed add
half a pint of stock and colour it with
gravy browning. Have ready any cold
meat which has been minced. Flavour
it with salt, pepper, a teaspoonful of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
Worcester sauce, and a little chopped
parsley and onion if liked. Put it all
into the sauce and stir it well round.
If too thick, add a little more stock.
Turn it out into a pie-dish and cover it
over with very soft-mashed potatoes,
and put in the oven to brown.</p>

<h4>MINCED CHICKEN</h4>

<p>1 cup of cold chicken, cut in small, even pieces.<br>
½ cup of chicken stock.<br>
1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
A pinch of pepper.<br>
1 oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Put the chicken stock—which is the
water the chicken was cooked in—or
good stock into the saucepan, and mix
in the chicken and seasoning, and cook
and stir till it is rather dry. Serve as
it is, or on squares of buttered toast.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
You can make any cold meat into hash
in this way, having it different every
time. Sometimes you can put in the
chopped onion, or a cup of hot peas.</p>

<h4>SARDINES ON TOAST</h4>

<p>Split the sardines, take out back-bone,
and remove all skin; put on each a
little butter and pepper. Dish on
squares of buttered toast, and serve
very hot.</p>

<h4>CHEESE FONDU</h4>

<p>This was a recipe her Aunt put in
Margaret’s book out of the one she had
made at the cookery-school.</p>

<p>1 cup of fresh bread-crumbs.<br>
2 cups of grated cheese.<br>
1 cup of milk.<br>
1 bit of soda as large as a pea.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span><br>
1 pinch of red pepper.<br>
1 teaspoonful of butter.<br>
2 eggs.</p>

<p>Put the butter in a saucepan to heat
while you beat the eggs light, without
separating them; let these stand while
you stir everything else into the pan,
beginning with the milk. Cook this
five minutes, stirring all the time, and
then put in the eggs and cook three
minutes more. Put six pieces of toast
on a hot plate, and pour the whole over
them, and send at once to the table to
be eaten very hot.</p>

<h4>WELSH RAREBIT</h4>

<p>Cut one or two slices of bread half-inch
thick, and toast it on both sides
and well butter it. Take half-pound of
good Cheddar cheese, cut it up in very
thin slices, and put in a stewpan, with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
two tablespoonfuls of thick cream, a
teaspoonful of mixed mustard, and a
little pepper. Stir all these over the
fire till the mixture is like cream; cut the
toast in square pieces and place on a
hot dish, and pour the cheese mixture
all over them, and brown quickly with
a red-hot salamander.</p>

<h4>PLAIN DRESSED LOBSTER</h4>

<p>Lay the lobster out flat, with the back
up. Get a knife into the middle of the
head and cut right down the middle
of the lobster. Break the claws from
the body and crack the shell, also cut
the body away from the head. Stick the
head up in the middle of the dish;
place the two halves of the body round
it, and the claws each side. Decorate
with parsley. Vinegar must be handed
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span></p>

<h4>VEAL LOAF</h4>

<p>1½ lbs. of veal and<br>
2 strips of bacon, chopped together.<br>
½ cup of bread-crumbs.<br>
1 beaten egg.<br>
½ teaspoonful of grated nutmeg.<br>
½ teaspoonful of black pepper.<br>
1½ teaspoonfuls of salt.</p>

<p>Bake three hours.</p>

<p>Chop the meat all together; then put
everything in a dish and stir in the
egg, beaten without separating, and mix
very well. Press it into a bread-pan
and put in the oven for three hours by
the clock.</p>

<p>Every half-hour pour over it a tablespoonful
hot water and butter mixed.
You can put a tablespoonful of butter
into a cup of water, and keep it on the
back of the stove ready all the time.
After the meat has baked two hours, put
a piece of heavy brown paper over the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>
top, and keep it there till the meat is
done, or it may get too brown. This is to
slice cold; it is very nice for a picnic.</p>

<h4>PRESSED CHICKEN</h4>

<p>This was one of the things Margaret
liked to make for Sunday-night supper.
Have a good-sized chicken cut up. Put
it in a saucepan and cover with cold
water, and cook very slowly and gently,
till the meat falls off the bones. When
it begins to grow tender, put in a half-teaspoonful
of salt. Take it out, and
cut it up in nice, even pieces, and put
all the bones back into the saucepan,
and let them cook till there is only about
a pint and half of broth. Add a little
more salt, and a sprinkling of pepper,
and strain this through a jelly bag. Mix
it with the chicken, and put them both
into a mould, and when cold put it on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
ice over night. After it has stood for an
hour, put a weight on it, to make it
firm. Slice with a very sharp knife,
and put on a dish with parsley all
round. This is a nice luncheon dish
for a summer day, as well as a supper
dish.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>When you have bits of cold meat
which you cannot slice, and yet which
you wish to serve in some nice way,
make this recipe, which sounds difficult,
but is really easy and very nice:</p>

<h4>MEAT SOUFFLÉ</h4>

<p>1 cup of white sauce.<br>
1 cup of chopped meat.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
Teaspoonful of chopped parsley.<br>
Half a teaspoonful of minced onion.</p>

<p>Put the parsley and onion in the
meat, and mix with the white sauce.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
Beat the yolks of the eggs and stir in,
and cook one minute, and then cool.
Beat the whites of the eggs and fold in,
and bake half an hour, or a little more
in a deep, buttered baking-dish. You
must serve this immediately, or it will
fall.</p>

<h4>LUNCH ROLL</h4>

<p>Half a pound of beefsteak, all lean;
half a pound of cooked ham, quite lean;
both to be passed through the mincing-machine;
half a pound of bread-crumbs,
two sprigs of mace, half a nutmeg, pepper
and salt to taste; two eggs, the yolks
and whites well beaten; two hard-boiled
eggs.</p>

<p>Mix all together and make in the
shape of a sausage. Tie very tightly
in a cloth and boil for two hours.</p>

<p>Glaze it and serve cold. The ham
usually makes it salt enough, and
cayenne is a great improvement.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span></p>

<h4>HASH</h4>

<p>Remove all fat and sinews from the
meat, and cut it into neat pieces and
leave these to marinate.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> Take a wineglassful
of stock, half a wineglassful of
white wine, a dessertspoonful of lemon
juice or vinegar, a teaspoonful of Harvey’s
or Worcester sauce, a teaspoonful of
finely chopped parsley, and a finely
chopped onion. Leave the meat in
this for two or three hours, then make
the following sauce:</p>

<p>For each half-pound of meat used,
peel and mince a small onion, and a
mushroom if at hand, and fry these
lightly in half an ounce of butter or
dripping. Next sprinkle in half an
ounce of flour. Then gradually add
half-pint of stock, using the marinate
also. Allow to cool a little. Lay in the
meat and let it stand by the fire until
quite hot, but not to boil.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="label">[A]</a> To soak up the flavour.</p>

</div>

<p>Some of the things Margaret made for
breakfast she made for lunch or supper,
too, such as scalloped eggs and omelettes.
She had some vegetables besides, such
as—</p>

<h4>BAKED TOMATOES</h4>

<p>6 large tomatoes.<br>
1 cup of bread-crumbs.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
1 tablespoonful of butter.<br>
1 slice of onion.</p>

<p>Put the butter in the frying-pan, and
when it bubbles put in the bread-crumbs,
the salt, and onion, with a dusting of
pepper, and stir till the crumbs are a
little brown and the onion is all cooked;
then take out the onion and throw it
away. Wipe the tomatoes with a clean
wet cloth, and cut out the stem and a
round hole or little well in the middle;
fill this with the crumbs, piling them up<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
well on top; put them in a baking-dish
and stand them in a hot oven; mix
a cup of hot water with a tablespoonful
of butter, and every little while take out
the baking-dish and wet the tomatoes
on top. Cook them about half an hour,
or till the skins get wrinkled all over.
Serve them in the dish they are cooked
in, if you like, or put each one on a small
plate; pour some of the juice in the
baking-dish over it, and stick a sprig
of parsley in the top.</p>

<h4>STUFFED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Wash six large potatoes, and scrub
them with a little brush till they are a
nice clean light brown, and bake them
for half an hour in a hot oven; or, if
they are quite large, bake them till they
are soft and puffy. Cut off one end
from each and take out the inside with
a teaspoon, holding the potato in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
towel as you do so, for it will be very
hot. Mix well this potato with two
tablespoonfuls of rich milk or cream, a
half-teaspoonful of salt and just as much
butter, and put this back into the shells.
Stand the potatoes side by side in a pan
close together, the open ends up, till
they are browned.</p>

<h4>PASTRY FOR PORK PIES</h4>

<p>6 ozs. of lard to 1 lb. of flour.<br>
Pinch of salt.<br>
1 pint of boiling milk.</p>

<p>Six pounds of flour generally makes seven pies.</p>

<p>Put the flour into a deep pan, rub in
the lard till not a bit is left, add the salt.
Make a hole in the centre of flour, take
the boiling milk, pour with the left hand
and stir with a large wooden spoon with
the right hand. Work all together into
a stiff paste. It may want a little more
milk, so it is best to have more ready.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>When all the flour is well worked in,
knead it for twenty minutes (near the
fire), it should then be quite smooth.
Cover over to keep warm, but not too
near the fire, and in an hour’s time it
will be ready for use.</p>

<h4>FRENCH DRESSING</h4>

<p>3 tablespoonfuls of oil.<br>
½ tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
3 shakes of pepper.</p>

<p>Stir together till all is well mixed.</p>

<p>Many people prefer this dressing without
pepper and with a saltspoonful of
sugar in its place; you can try it both
ways.</p>

<h4>TOMATO AND LETTUCE SALAD</h4>

<p>Peel four tomatoes; you can do this
most easily by pouring boiling water<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
over them and skinning them when they
wrinkle, but you must drain off all the
water afterward, and let them get firm
in the refrigerator; wash the lettuce and
gently pat it dry with a clean cloth;
slice the tomatoes thin, pour off the
juice, and arrange four slices on each
plate of lettuce, or mix them together
in the large bowl, and pour the dressing
over.</p>

<h4>EGG SALAD</h4>

<p>Cut up six hard-boiled eggs into quarters,
lay them on lettuce, and pour the
dressing over.</p>

<h4>HAM MOUSSE</h4>

<p>Whip two gills of cream stiffly, and
stir into this one gill of liquid aspic
and half-pound of cold cooked minced
ham, and just enough cochineal to make<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
it all a very delicate pink. Whip this
together for two or three minutes, pack
it into a tall slender mould, and set it
on ice for two or three hours.</p>

<h4>CAULIFLOWER SALAD</h4>

<p>Take cold boiled cauliflower and pick
it up into nice pieces; pour the dressing
over, and put on the ice till you need it.</p>

<h4>PORK-PIE MEAT</h4>

<p>One pound of pork meat and about
three ounces of pork fat. Cut this up
into small squares. Flavour this with
a quarter-ounce of salt and a quarter-ounce
of pepper. Put this into your
pie-crust and bake for three hours.
The paste must be brushed over with
egg, so that it looks yellow when it is
cooked. Be careful it does not burn.</p>

<p>Have some stock made from pork<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
bones which has been flavoured with
about one ounce of whole mixed spice
and pepper and salt. When the pie is
warm, cut a small hole in the top and
pour into it as much of the stock as
the pie will hold. When cold it will
have jelly inside it.</p>

<h4>HASH (ORDINARY)</h4>

<p>Cut up into slices any cold meat, removing
all fat and sinews. Put in a
saucepan an ounce of butter and a
tablespoonful of flour. Mix together
when hot, and add a pint of stock;
colour it with browning, and add salt
and pepper to taste and a teaspoonful
of Worcester sauce.</p>

<h4>BRAWN</h4>

<p>To a pig’s head weighing six pounds,
add one and a half pounds of lean beef,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
two tablespoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful
of pepper, three pounded
cloves, and half a blade of mace. Boil
the beef and head three hours. Take
away all the bones, chop the meat up,
add the seasoning and some of the
liquor it is boiled in, to make it moist,
and put it in a mould and turn out
when cold.</p>

<h4>MAYONNAISE</h4>

<p>Yolk of 1 egg.<br>
½ cup of olive-oil.<br>
1 tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar.<br>
½ teaspoonful of salt.<br>
Pinch of red pepper.</p>

<p>Put the yolk of the egg into a very
cold bowl; it is better to put the bowl,
the egg, the oil, and the beater all on
the ice a half-hour before you need
them, for then the mayonnaise comes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
quicker. Beat the egg till the yolk is
very light indeed; then let some one
else begin to put in the oil, one drop at
a time, till the mayonnaise becomes so
thick it is difficult to beat; then put in
a drop or two of lemon or vinegar, and
this will thin it so that you can use the oil
again; keep on doing this till you have
nearly a cup of the dressing. If you
need more oil than the recipe calls for,
use it, and towards the last add two or
three drops at a time. When you have
enough, and it is stiff enough, put in the
pepper and salt and it is done. Never
use mustard except with lobster, as
this will spoil the taste. Some salads,
especially vegetable, need very thick
mayonnaise, and then it is better to
make it with lemon juice, while one to
use with meats may be thinner, and
then the vinegar will do; the lemon
juice makes it thick. Always taste it
before using it, to see if it is just right,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">[72]</span>
and, if not, put in more salt, or whatever
it needs. You will soon learn.
Most people think mayonnaise is very
difficult to make, but, really, it is as
easy as baking potatoes, after you have
once learned how. Every salad given
before is just as nice with mayonnaise
as with French dressing, and you can
try each one both ways; then there
are these, which are better with mayonnaise:</p>

<h4>CHICKEN SALAD</h4>

<p>1 cup of chicken, cut in large bits.<br>
½ cup of celery, cut up and then dried.<br>
2 hard-boiled eggs, cut into good-sized pieces.<br>
6 olives, stoned and cut up.<br>
½ cup of mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Mix all very lightly together, as stirring
will make the salad messy; put
on lettuce.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span></p>

<h4>LOBSTER SALAD</h4>

<p>1 cup of lobster, cut in large bits.<br>
2 hard-boiled eggs, cut in pieces.<br>
½ teaspoonful of dry mustard, stirred in.<br>
½ cup of mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Mix and put on lettuce.</p>

<h4>CELERY SALAD</h4>

<p>2 heads of celery.<br>
3 hard-boiled eggs (or else 1 cup of English walnuts).<br>
½ cup of very stiff mayonnaise.</p>

<p>Wash, wipe, and cut the celery into
pieces as large as the first joint of your
little finger, and then rub it in a clean
towel till it is as dry as can be. Cut
up the eggs, sprinkle all with salt, and
add the mayonnaise and lay on lettuce.
Or mix the celery and the walnuts and
mayonnaise; either salad is nice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span></p>

<h4>SCOTCH WOODCOCK</h4>

<p>Cut one or two slices of bread half an
inch thick, toast it and butter it well.
Spread over it some anchovy paste and
cut into as many pieces as you require.
Have a saucepan ready and one egg for
each person; just break the yolks and
half an ounce of butter to each egg.
Put salt and pepper into it, put it on
the fire and stir till it becomes thick,
then add one tablespoonful of cream.
Put the buttered eggs on the top of
the anchovy toast and serve very
hot. The buttered egg must not be
too thick.</p>

<h4>SHRIMP TOAST</h4>

<p>Mix in a stewpan the yolks of two
eggs, a tablespoonful cream, one teaspoonful
anchovy sauce. Soak in this
a thick round of buttered toast. Peel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
some shrimps and place on the toast
and serve very hot.</p>

<h4>TO PICKLE BEEF OR TONGUE</h4>

<p>Put into a large saucepan four quarts
of cold water, two pounds common salt,
two ounces of saltpetre, half-pound
brown pickling sugar, a few peppercorns,
four bay-leaves, six cloves.</p>

<p>Let it all boil up well; then skim.
When cold pour into an earthenware
pan; then put in the meat and turn it
every day for ten or fourteen days.</p>

<h4>TONGUE TOAST</h4>

<p>Grate finely the remains of a tongue,
and mix it with the yolk of an egg, a
tablespoonful of cream, finely chopped
parsley, pepper, and a little salt.</p>

<p>Make it very hot, but not boiling, and
pour it on to fingers of well-buttered
toast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>Grated ham can also be prepared
exactly the same, with a little fine
chopped onion if liked.</p>

<h4>CHEESE STRAWS</h4>

<p>One ounce grated cheese, one ounce
butter, slightly over one ounce of flour,
a little pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Put all into a basin and work into a
stiff paste; then roll out and cut them
evenly with a knife in lengths. Place
on a baking-sheet, a little distance apart,
and bake in a warm oven about ten
minutes, but they must be watched, so
as not to get too brown. They should
be a pale straw colour.</p>

<h4>POTATO SALAD</h4>

<p>3 cold boiled potatoes.<br>
3 hard-boiled eggs.<br>
½ cup of English walnuts.<br>
12 olives.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>Break up the walnuts, saving a dozen
halves unbroken. Cut the potatoes
and eggs into bits of even size, as large
as the tip of your finger; stone the olives
and cut them up, too; mix them together
in a bowl, but do not stir them
much, or you will break the potatoes;
sprinkle well with French dressing, and
put on the ice; when it is lunch or
supper time, mix quickly, only once,
with stiff mayonnaise, and put on
lettuce. This is a delicious salad to
have with cold meats.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Margaret’s mother liked to have gingerbread
for lunch often, so those things
came next in the cookery-book.</p>

<h4>GINGERBREAD</h4>

<p>1 cup of sugar.<br>
1 egg.<br>
1 teaspoonful of soda.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span><br>
1 teaspoonful of ginger.<br>
1 tablespoonful of melted butter.<br>
½ cup of milk.<br>
2 cups of flour.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs without separating, but
very light; put the soda into the sugar,
put them in the milk, with the ginger
and butter, then one cup of flour—measure
in a medium-sized cup and only
level full—then the egg, and last the rest
of the flour. Bake in a buttered biscuit-tin.
For a change, sometimes add a
teaspoonful of cloves and cinnamon,
mixed, to this, and a cup of chopped
raisins put in the flour, or a cup of
chopped almonds.</p>

<h4>SOFT GINGERBREAD, TO BE EATEN HOT</h4>

<p>1 cup sugar.<br>
½ cup boiling water.<br>
¼ cup melted butter.<br>
1½ cups flour.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span><br>
¾ teaspoonful soda.<br>
1 teaspoonful ginger.<br>
½ teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Put the soda in the sugar and beat
it well in a good-sized bowl; then put
in the melted butter, ginger, salt, and
flour, and beat again; and add last the
water, very hot indeed. Have a buttered
tin ready, and put it at once in
the oven; when half-baked, it is well
to put a piece of paper over it, as all
gingerbread burns easily.</p>

<p>You can add cloves and cinnamon to
this recipe, and sometimes you can make
it and serve it hot as a pudding, with
a sauce of sugar and water, thickened
and flavoured.</p>

<h4>GINGER BUNS</h4>

<p>½ cup butter.<br>
1 cup sugar.<br>
½ cup brown sugar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span><br>
1 teaspoonful ginger.<br>
1 tablespoonful mixed cinnamon and cloves.<br>
1 teaspoonful soda, dissolved in a tablespoonful of water.<br>
Flour enough to make it so stiff you cannot stir it with a spoon.</p>

<p>Melt the sugar and butter together
on the stove, and then take the saucepan
off and add the rest of the things
in the recipe, and turn the dough out
on a floured board and roll it very thin,
and cut in circles with a biscuit-cutter.
Put a little flour on the bottom of four
shallow pans, lift the buns with the
cake-turner and lay them in, and put
them in the oven. They will bake very
quickly, so you must watch them.
When you want these to be extra nice,
put a teaspoonful of mixed cinnamon
and cloves in them and sprinkle the
tops with sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span></p>

<h4>GRANDMOTHER’S SUGAR BUNS</h4>

<p>1 cup of butter.<br>
2 cups of sugar.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
1 cup of milk.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.<br>
Flour enough to roll out easily.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a cream;
put in the milk, then the eggs beaten
together lightly, then two cups of flour,
into which you have sifted the baking-powder;
then the vanilla. Take a bit
of this and put it on the floured board
and see if it “rolls out easily,” and, if
it does not, but is soft and sticky, put
in a handful more of flour. These buns
must not be any stiffer than you can
help, or they will not be good, so try
not to use any more flour than you
are obliged to.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span></p>

<h4>TEA</h4>

<p>1 teaspoonful of black tea for each person.<br>
1 teaspoonful for the pot.<br>
Boiling water.</p>

<p>Fill the kettle half-full of fresh, cold
water, because you cannot make good
tea with water which has been once
heated. When it is very hot, fill the
teapot and put it where it will keep
warm. When the water boils very hard,
empty out the teapot, put in the tea,
and pour on it the boiling water; do
not stand it on the stove, as too many
people do, but send it right to the table;
it will be ready as soon as it is time to
pour out—about three minutes. If you
are making tea for only one person, you
will need two teaspoonfuls of tea, as
you will see by the recipe, and two
small cups of water will be enough. If
for more, put in a teaspoonful for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
each person, and one cup of water
more.</p>

<h4>GINGER BEER</h4>

<p>4 gallons water.<br>
4 lbs. lump sugar.<br>
4 oz. ginger.<br>
3 oz. cream of tartar.<br>
4 lemons.</p>

<p>Bruise the ginger and slice the lemons;
take out the pips, then put all the ingredients
into a pan and pour over the
boiling water. Let it stand until it is
luke-warm, then add one tablespoonful
of fresh barm put on a piece of toasted
bread to remain on the top. If this is
done at night it will be ready to bottle
next morning.</p>

<h4>LEMONADE</h4>

<p>Slice up six lemons and pour over
them three quarts of boiling water and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
enough sugar to taste. Can be used
when cold.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE</h4>

<p>2 cups of boiling water.<br>
2 cups of boiling milk.<br>
4 teaspoonfuls of grated chocolate.<br>
4 teaspoonfuls of sugar.</p>

<p>Scrape the chocolate off the bar, mix
it with the boiling water, and stir till it
dissolves; mix the milk and sugar in
them and boil for one minute. If you
wish to have it nicer, put a small teaspoonful
of vanilla in the chocolate-pot,
and pour the hot chocolate in on it
when it is done, and have a little bowl
of whipped cream to send to the table
with it, so that one spoonful may be
put on top of each cup.</p>

<h4>COCOA</h4>

<p>6 teaspoonfuls of cocoa.<br>
1½ cups of boiling water.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span><br>
1½ cups of boiling milk.<br>
1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar.</p>

<p>Put the cocoa into the boiling water
and stir till it dissolves, then put in the
boiling milk and boil hard two minutes,
stirring it all the time: take from the
fire and put in the sugar and stir again.
If you like it quite sweet, you may have
to use more sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span></p>

<p>At first, of course, Margaret could not
get dinner all alone; indeed, it took
her almost a year to learn how to cook
everything needed—soup, vegetables,
meat, salad, and sweets; but at first
she helped the cook, and each day she
cooked something. Then she began to
arrange very easy dinners when cook
was out, such as cream soup, beefsteak
or veal cutlets, with potatoes and one
vegetable, and a plain lettuce salad,
with a cold sweet made in the morning.
The first time she really did every
single thing alone, Margaret’s father
gave her half a crown; he said it was
a “tip” for the best dinner he ever
ate.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">SOUPS</h3>

<h4>STOCK FOR ORDINARY SOUP</h4>

<p>Put all the bones you have left from
any joints, break them up small and
put in a large saucepan and fill with
cold water till the bones are covered.
Put in an onion, carrot, and a small
stick of celery. Boil all down till the
bones become quite clean. Pour off
into a basin, and when wanted remove
the fat from the top and flavour it with
what vegetable you want your soup
made of, such as celery, or pea.</p>

<h4>VEGETABLE MARROW SOUP</h4>

<p>Peel and cut in quarters a small
marrow and remove the seeds. Melt
an ounce of butter in a stewpan and
put in the marrow with a little pepper
and salt, a lump of sugar, and a grate of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[91]</span>
nutmeg. Toss it over fire for a few
minutes, and moisten with as much
white stock as will cover it. Let it
stew gently till tender, and then pass
through a fine hair-sieve. Put then
with it as much boiling stock as will
make it the thickness of cream. Add
half a pint of cream and season with
pepper and salt. Put over the fire till
very hot. Tomato soup is made the
same way.</p>

<h4>CREAM OF POTATO</h4>

<p>This is one of the best and most delicate
soups.</p>

<p>5 freshly boiled potatoes.<br>
1 slice of onion.<br>
1 quart of stock.<br>
1 small teaspoonful of salt.<br>
1 teaspoonful of chopped parsley.</p>

<p>Boil the onion and salt in the stock.
It requires no thickening, as if the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
potatoes are passed through a sieve and
added to the stock they will make it
thick enough. Add the parsley after
the soup is in the tureen, as it will turn
brown if put in too soon. The yolk of
an egg, beaten, can be added, if required,
to make the soup richer.</p>

<h4>CREAM OF SPINACH</h4>

<p>1 pint of cold cooked spinach.<br>
1 quart of stock.</p>

<p>Heat the spinach, using a little of the
quart of stock with it, and press through
the sieve; thicken the rest of the stock
and the seasoning, and strain again. It
is better to use cayenne pepper instead
of black with spinach.</p>

<h4>CREAM OF TOMATO SOUP, CALLED
TOMATO BISQUE</h4>

<p>6 large tomatoes, cut up.<br>
2 slices onion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span><br>
2 sprigs parsley.<br>
1 teaspoonful sugar.<br>
½ teaspoonful salt.<br>
1 quart stock.<br>
1 tablespoonful butter.<br>
1 tablespoonful flour.</p>

<p>Cook the tomatoes with the onion,
parsley, sugar, and salt for twenty minutes,
with a little of the stock. Make
the stock and flour and butter into
white sauce as usual; strain the tomato,
mix the two, and strain through
a sieve.</p>

<p>Sometimes add a stalk of celery to
the other seasoning as it cooks, and a
little cream before serving.</p>

<h4>OYSTER SOUP</h4>

<p>1 pint oysters.<br>
1 quart rich stock.<br>
½ teaspoonful salt.</p>

<p>Drain off the oyster juice, add the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
stock, boil it for one minute, and skim
it well. Then drop in the oysters and
cook one minute, or till the edges begin
to curl, and it is done. This soup is not
thickened at all; but if you like you
may add two tablespoonfuls of cream.</p>

<h4>MEAT SOUPS</h4>

<p>You can make meat soup, or stock,
out of almost any kind of meat, cooked
or raw, with bones or without. Many
cooks never buy fresh meat for it, and
others think they must always have it.
It is best to learn both ways.</p>

<h4>PLAIN MEAT SOUP</h4>

<p>5 lbs. of shin of beef.<br>
5 quarts of water.<br>
1 small tablespoonful of salt.<br>
1 head of celery, cut up.<br>
1 onion.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span><br>
1 carrot.<br>
1 turnip.<br>
1 sprig of parsley.<br>
2 bay-leaves.<br>
6 whole cloves.</p>

<p>Cut the meat off the bone. Put the
bone in a clean saucepan first, and then
the meat on top, and pour in the water;
cover, and let this stand on the back
of the stove an hour, then draw it forward
and let it cook. This will bring
scum on the water in half an hour, and
you must carefully pour in a cup of cold
water and skim off everything which
rises to the top. Cover the saucepan
tightly, and cook very slowly indeed for
four hours; then put in the cut-up
vegetables and cook one hour more,
always just simmering, not boiling hard.
Then it is done, and you can put in the
salt, and strain the soup first through
a heavy wire sieve, and then through a
flannel bag, and set it away to get cold,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
and you will have a strong, clear,
delicious stock, which you can put
many things in to have variety.</p>

<h4>CLEAR VEGETABLE SOUP</h4>

<p>Slice one carrot, one turnip, and one
potato, and cut them either into small,
even strips, or into tiny cubes, or take
a vegetable cutter and cut out fancy
shapes. Simmer them about twenty
minutes in a little water. Meanwhile,
take two pints of soup stock and heat
it. Sprinkle a little salt over the
vegetables and drain them; put them
in the soup-tureen and pour the hot
soup over.</p>

<h4>SPLIT PEA SOUP</h4>

<p>1 pint of split peas.<br>
1½ quarts of boiling water.<br>
1 quart of soup stock.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span><br>
1 small teaspoonful of salt.<br>
3 shakes of pepper.</p>

<p>Wash the peas in cold water and
throw away those which float, as they
are bad. Soak them overnight, and in
the morning pour away the water on
them and cover them with a quart of
the boiling water in the recipe, and cook
an hour and a half. Put in the rest of
the water and the stock, and press the
whole through a sieve, and, after washing
and wiping the saucepan, put the
soup back to heat, adding the salt and
pepper.</p>

<h4>TOMATO SOUP</h4>

<p>1 tin tomatoes, or 1 quart of fresh stewed ones.<br>
1 pint of stock.<br>
1 tablespoonful of butter.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of flour.<br>
1 teaspoonful of sugar.<br>
1 small onion, cut up.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span><br>
1 sprig of parsley.<br>
1 bay-leaf.<br>
1 small teaspoonful of salt.<br>
3 shakes of pepper.</p>

<p>Put the tomatoes into a saucepan
with the parsley, onion, bay-leaf, and
stock, and cook fifteen minutes, and
then strain through a sieve. Wash
the saucepan and put the tomatoes
back in it, and put on to boil again;
melt the butter, rub smooth with the
flour, and put into the soup while it
boils, and stir till it is perfectly smooth.
Then add the sugar, salt and pepper,
and soda, and strain into the hot
tureen. Serve croûtons with this soup.
They are made by cutting tiny little
squares of bread and fried in a little
butter till they become crisp.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN OR TURKEY SOUP</h4>

<p>Break up the bones and cover with
cold water; add a slice of onion, a bay-leaf,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>
and a sprig of parsley, and cook
all day, adding water when necessary,
and skimming. Cool, take off the
grease, heat again, and strain. Serve
with small, even squares of chicken
meat in it, or a little cooked rice and
salt. Many people like a small pinch
of cinnamon in turkey soup.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">VEGETABLES</h3>

<h4>MASHED POTATOES</h4>

<p>6 large potatoes.<br>
½ cup hot milk.<br>
Butter the size of a walnut.<br>
3 teaspoonfuls salt.<br>
3 shakes of pepper.</p>

<p>Peel and boil the potatoes till tender;
then turn off the water and stand them
on the back of the stove with a cover
half over them, where they will keep
hot while they get dry and floury, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
do not let them burn; shake the saucepan
every little while. Heat the milk
with the butter, salt, and pepper in it;
mash the potatoes well, either with the
wooden potato-masher or with a wire
one, and put in the milk little by little.
When they are all free from lumps, pile
them lightly in the vegetable-dish as
they are. Do not smooth them over
the top.</p>

<h4>BEETS</h4>

<p>Wash the beets but do not peel them.
Boil them gently for three-quarters of
an hour, or till they can be pierced
easily with a straw. Then skin them
and slice in a hot dish, dusting each
layer with a little salt, pepper, and
melted butter. Those which are left
over may have a little vinegar poured
over them, to make them into pickles
for luncheon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>Once Margaret made something very
nice by a recipe her Aunt put in her
book. It was called—</p>

<h4>STUFFED BEETS</h4>

<p>1 tin French peas.<br>
6 medium-sized beets.</p>

<p>Boil the beets as before and skin
them, but leave them whole. Heat the
peas after the juice has been turned off,
and season them with salt and pepper.
Cut off the stem end of each beet so
that it will stand steadily, and scoop
a round place in the other end; sprinkle
each beet with salt and pepper, and put
a tiny bit of butter down in this little
well, and then fill it high with the peas
it will hold.</p>

<h4>PEAS</h4>

<p>Shell them and drop them into a
saucepan of boiling water, into which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>
you have put a teaspoonful of salt and
a pinch of soda. Boil them till they
are tender, from fifteen minutes, if they
are fresh from the garden, to half an
hour or more, if they have stood in the
grocer’s a day or two. When they are
done they will have little dents in their
sides, and you can easily mash two or
three with a fork on a plate. Then
drain off the water, put in three shakes
of pepper, more salt if they do not
taste just right, and a piece of butter
the size of a walnut, and shake them
till the butter melts; serve in a hot
covered dish.</p>

<h4>FRENCH BEANS</h4>

<p>Pull off the strings and cut off the
ends; hold three or four beans in your
hand and cut them into long, very
narrow strips, not into square pieces.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
Then cook them exactly as you did the
peas.</p>

<h4>STEWED TOMATOES</h4>

<p>6 large tomatoes.<br>
1 teaspoonful of salt.<br>
1 teaspoonful of sugar.<br>
3 shakes of pepper.<br>
Butter as large as a walnut.</p>

<p>Peel and cut the tomatoes up small,
saving the juice; put together in a
saucepan with the seasoning. Simmer
twenty minutes, stirring till it is smooth,
and last put in half a cup of bread-crumbs.
Serve in a hot, covered dish.</p>

<h4>ASPARAGUS</h4>

<p>Untie the bunch, scrape the stalks
clean, and put it in cold water for half
an hour. Tie the bunch again, and cut
enough off the white ends to make all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
the pieces of the same length. Stand
them in boiling water in a saucepan,
and cook gently for about twenty minutes.
Lay on a dish, on squares of
buttered toast.</p>

<h4>ONIONS</h4>

<p>Peel off the outside skin and cook
them in boiling, salted water till they
are tender; drain them, put them in
a baking-dish, and pour over them a
tablespoonful of melted butter, three
shakes of pepper, and a sprinkling of
salt, and put in the oven and brown a
very little. Or, cover them with a cup
of white sauce instead of the melted
butter, and sprinkle with salt and pepper,
but do not put in the oven.</p>

<h4>FRIED POTATOES</h4>

<p>Wash and peel sufficient potatoes,
then chop them fine, and put them into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
cold water. Put some bacon dripping
into an iron frying-pan, and when very
hot turn the potatoes into it (previously
dried by pressing in a clean cloth).
Add salt and pepper. Cook until soft;
then draw the pan to a hotter part of
the stove and brown. Serve very hot.</p>

<h4>CARROT CROQUETTES</h4>

<p>Wash and scrape a sufficient number
of carrots; stew them until very soft,
drain and mash and season with salt,
pepper, and butter; then bind together
with the yolk of an egg. When cool
enough to handle, shape into balls,
dredge with brown bread-crumbs, and
fry in deep fat till brown. Serve up
with parsley.</p>

<h4>MACARONI</h4>

<p>6 long pieces of macaroni.<br>
1 cup of white sauce.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span><br>
½ pound of cheese.<br>
Pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Break up the macaroni into small
pieces, and boil fifteen minutes in salted
water, shaking the saucepan often.
Pour off the water. Butter a dish, put
in a layer of macaroni, a good sprinkle
of salt, then a very little white sauce,
and a layer of grated cheese, sprinkled
over with a tiny dusting of pepper; only
use a tiny bit. Then cover with a thin
layer of white sauce, and so on till the
dish is full, with the last layer of white
sauce covered with an extra thick one
of the cheese. Bake till brown.</p>

<p>Margaret’s mother got this recipe in
Paris, and she thought it a very nice
one.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>After the soup, meat, and vegetables
at dinner came the salad; for this Margaret
almost always had lettuce, with
French dressing, as mayonnaise seemed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>
too heavy for dinner. Sometimes she
had nice watercress; very occasionally
she had celery with mayonnaise.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">SWEETS</h3>

<h4>BLANCMANGE</h4>

<p>1 pint of milk.<br>
2 heaping tablespoonfuls of cornflour.<br>
3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.<br>
Whites of three eggs.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Beat the whites of the eggs very stiff.
Mix the cornflour with half a cup of
the milk, and stir it till it melts. Mix
the rest of the milk and the sugar, and
put them on the fire in the double
saucepan. When it bubbles, stir up
the cornflour and milk well, and stir
them in and cook and stir till it gets as
thick as oatmeal; then turn in the eggs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[108]</span>
and stir them lightly, and cook for a
minute more. Take it off the stove,
mix in the vanilla, and put in a mould
to cool. When dinner is ready, turn it
out on a dish and put small bits of red
jelly round it, or pieces of preserved
ginger, or a pretty circle of preserved
peaches, or preserved pineapple. Have
a pitcher of cream to pass with it, or
have a nice bowl of whipped cream. If
you have a ring-mould, let it harden in
that, and have the whipped cream piled
in the centre after it is on the dish, and
put the jelly or preserves round last.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE BLANCMANGE</h4>

<p>Use the same recipe as before, but
put in one more tablespoonful of sugar.
Then shave thin two squares of chocolate,
and stand on the fire till it melts,
and stir it in very thoroughly before
you put in the eggs. Instead of pouring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
this into one large mould, put it in egg-cups
to harden; turn these out carefully,
each on a separate plate, and put
a spoonful of whipped cream by each
one.</p>

<h4>BAKED CUSTARD</h4>

<p>2 cups of milk.<br>
Yolks of two eggs.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of sugar.<br>
A little nutmeg.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs till they are light; mix
the milk and sugar till the sugar melts;
put the two together, and pour into a
nice baking-dish, or into small cups, and
dust the nutmeg over the tops. Bake
till the top is brown, and till when you
put a knife-blade into the custard it
comes out clean.</p>

<h4>COCOANUT CUSTARD</h4>

<p>Add a cup of cocoanut to the above
recipe and bake it in one dish, stirring<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
it up two or three times from the
bottom, but, after it begins to brown,
leaving it alone to finish. Do not put
any nutmeg on it.</p>

<h4>TAPIOCA PUDDING</h4>

<p>2 tablespoonfuls of tapioca.<br>
Yolks of two eggs.<br>
½ cup of sugar.<br>
1 quart of milk.</p>

<p>Put the tapioca into a small half-cup
of water and let it stand one hour.
Then drain it and put it in the milk in
the double saucepan, and cook and stir
it till the tapioca looks clear, like glass.
Beat the eggs and mix the sugar with
them, and beat again till both are light,
and put them with the milk and tapioca
and cook three minutes, stirring all the
time. Then take it off the fire and add
a saltspoonful of salt and a half-teaspoonful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
of vanilla, and let it get
perfectly cold.</p>

<h4>FLOATING ISLAND</h4>

<p>1 pint of milk.<br>
3 eggs.<br>
⅓ cup of sugar.</p>

<p>Put the milk on the stove to heat
in a good-sized pan. Beat the whites
of the eggs very stiff, and as soon as
the milk scalds—that is, gets a little
wrinkled on top—drop spoonfuls of
the egg on to it in little islands; let
them stand there to cook just one
minute, and then with the skimmer
take them off and lay them on a plate.
Put the milk where it will keep hot, but
not boil, while you beat the yolks of the
eggs stiff, mixing in the sugar and beating
that, too. Pour the milk into the
bowl of egg, a little at a time, beating
all the while, and then put it in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
double boiler and cook till it is as thick
as cream. Take it off the fire, stir in
a saltspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful
of vanilla, and set it away to
cool. When it is dinner-time, strain
the custard into a pretty dish and slip
the whites off on top, one by one. If
you like, you can dot them over with
very tiny specks of red jelly.</p>

<h4>CAKE AND CUSTARD</h4>

<p>Make a plain boiled custard, just as
before, with—</p>

<p>1 pint of milk.<br>
Yolks of three eggs.<br>
⅓ cup of sugar.<br>
1 saltspoonful of salt.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs and sugar, add the hot
milk, and cook till creamy; put in the
salt and vanilla, and cool. Then cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>
stale cake into strips, or split ladyfingers
into halves, and spread with
jam. Put them on the sides and bottom
of a flat glass dish, and gently pour
the custard over.</p>

<h4>APPLE CHARLOTTE</h4>

<p>Peel, core, and slice six apples. Butter
a baking-dish and sprinkle the inside
all over with fine bread-crumbs.
Then take six very thin slices of buttered
bread and line the sides and bottom
of the dish. Put a layer of apples
an inch thick, a thin layer of brown
sugar, six small pieces of butter, and a
dusting of cinnamon, another layer of
crumbs, another of apples and sugar, and
so on till the dish is full, with crumbs
and butter on top, and three tablespoonfuls
of sugar poured over. Bake this
one hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span></p>

<h4>LEMON PUDDING</h4>

<p>1 cup of sugar.<br>
4 eggs.<br>
2 lemons.<br>
1 pint of milk.<br>
1 tablespoonful of granulated sugar.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of cornflour.<br>
1 pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Wet the cornflour with half a cup
of the milk, and heat what is left. Stir
up the cornflour well, and when the
milk is hot put it in and stir; then boil
five minutes, stirring all the time. Melt
the butter, and put that in with a pinch
of salt, and cool it. Beat the yolks of
the eggs, and add the sugar, the juice
of both lemons, and the grated rind of
one, pour into the milk, and stir well;
put in a buttered baking-dish and bake
till slightly brown. Take it out of the
oven; beat the whites of two of the
eggs with a tablespoonful of granulated<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
sugar, and pile lightly on top, and put
in the oven again till it is just brown.
This is a very nice recipe.</p>

<h4>RICE PUDDING WITH RAISINS</h4>

<p>1 quart of milk.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of rice.<br>
⅓ cup of sugar.<br>
½ cup of seeded raisins.</p>

<p>Wash the rice and the raisins and stir
everything together till the sugar dissolves;
then put it in a baking-dish
in the oven. Every little while open
the door and see if a light brown crust
is forming on top, and, if it is, stir the
pudding all up from the bottom and
push down the crust. Keep on doing
this till the rice swells and makes the
milk all thick and creamy, which it will
after about an hour. Then let the pudding
cook, and when it is a nice deep<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
brown take it out and let it get very
cold.</p>

<h4>BREAD PUDDING</h4>

<p>2 cups of milk.<br>
1 cup of soft bread-crumbs.<br>
1 tablespoonful of sugar.<br>
2 egg yolks.<br>
1 egg white.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.<br>
1 saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Crumb the bread evenly and soak in
the milk till soft. Beat it till smooth,
and put in the beaten yolks of the eggs,
the sugar, vanilla, and salt, and last
the beaten white of the egg. Put it
in a buttered pudding-dish, and stand
this in a pan of hot water in the oven
for fifteen minutes. Take it out and
spread its top with jam, and cover with
the beaten white of the other egg, with
one tablespoonful of granulated sugar
put in it, and brown in the oven. You<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
can eat this as it is, or with cream, and
you may serve it either hot or cold.</p>

<p>Sometimes you can put a cup of
washed raisins into the bread-crumbs
and milk, and mix in the other things;
sometimes you can put in a cup of
chopped almonds, or a little preserved
ginger. Marmalade is especially nice
on bread pudding.</p>

<h4>ORANGE PUDDING</h4>

<p>Make just like Lemon Pudding, but
use three oranges instead of two lemons.</p>

<h4>CABINET PUDDING</h4>

<p>1 pint of milk.<br>
Yolks of 3 eggs.<br>
3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.<br>
1 saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs, add the sugar, and
stir them into the milk, which must be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>
very hot, but not boiling; stir till it
thickens, and then take it from the fire.
Put a layer of washed raisins in the
bottom of a mould, then a layer of
slices of stale cake or Savoy biscuits;
then more raisins round the edge of
the mould, and more cake, till the
mould is full. Pour the custard over
very slowly, so the cake will soak well,
and bake in a pan of water in the oven
for an hour. This pudding is to be
eaten hot, with any sauce you like, such
as Foamy Sauce.</p>

<p>Cut-up figs are nice to use with the
raisins, and chopped nuts are a delicious
addition, dropped between the layers
of cake.</p>

<h4>COTTAGE PUDDING</h4>

<p>1 egg.<br>
1 cup sugar.<br>
½ cup milk.<br>
1½ teaspoonfuls baking-powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>Beat the yolk of the egg light, add
the sugar slowly, and beat more, then
put in the milk, the flour, the whites
of the eggs beaten stiff, and last of all
the baking-powder, and stir it up well.
Put in a greased pan and bake nearly
half an hour. If you want this very
nice, put in half a cup of chopped figs,
mixed with part of the flour.</p>

<p>Serve with Foamy Sauce.</p>

<h4>PRUNE WHIPS</h4>

<p>This was a cookery-school recipe
which the Aunt put in, because she said
it was the best sort of a pudding for
little girls to make and like.</p>

<p>1 tablespoonful of powdered sugar.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of stewed prunes.<br>
White of 1 egg.</p>

<p>Cook the prunes till soft, take out
the stones, and mash the prunes fine.
Beat the white of the egg very stiff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
mix in the sugar and prunes, and bake
in small buttered dishes. Serve hot or
cold, with cream.</p>

<h4>JUNKET</h4>

<p>1 junket tablet.<br>
1 quart milk.<br>
½ cup sugar.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Break up the junket tablet—or rennet
can be used—into small pieces, and put
them into a tablespoonful of water to
dissolve. Put the sugar into the milk
with the vanilla, and stir till it is dissolved.
Warm the milk a little, but
only till it is as warm as your finger, so
that if you try it by touching it with
the tip, you do not feel it at all as colder
or warmer. Then quickly turn in the
water with the tablet melted in it, stirring
it only once, and pour immediately
into small cups on the table. These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
must stand for half an hour without
being moved, and then the junket will
be stiff. In winter you must warm the
cups till they are like the milk. This
is very nice with a spoonful of whipped
cream on each cup, and bits of preserved
ginger or of jelly on it.</p>

<h4>STRAWBERRY SHORTCAKE</h4>

<p>Margaret’s mother called this the
Thousand Mile Shortcake, because she
sent so far for the recipe to the place
where she had once eaten it, when
she thought it the best she had ever
tasted.</p>

<p>1 pint flour.<br>
½ cup butter.<br>
1 egg.<br>
1 teaspoonful baking-powder.<br>
½ cup milk.<br>
1 saltspoonful salt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>Mix the baking-powder and salt with
the flour and sift all together. The
butter should stand on the kitchen table
till it is warm and ready to melt, when
it may be mixed in with a spoon, and
then the egg, well beaten, and the
milk.</p>

<p>Divide the dough into halves; put
one in a round biscuit-tin, butter it,
and lay the other half on top, evenly.
Bake a light brown. When you take it
out of the oven, let it cool, and then
lift the layer apart. Mash the strawberries,
keeping out some of the biggest
ones for the top of the cake, and put on
the bottom layer; put a small half-cup
of powdered sugar on them, and
put the top layer on. Dust this over
with sugar till it is white, and set the
large berries about on it, or cover the
top with whipped cream and put the
strawberries on this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span></p>

<h4>SHORTCAKE</h4>

<p>1 small cup sugar.<br>
½ cup butter.<br>
1 cup cold water.<br>
1 egg.<br>
2 cups flour.<br>
3 teaspoonfuls baking-powder.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a
cream; sift the flour and baking-powder
together; beat the egg stiff without
separating; put the egg with the sugar
and butter, add the water and flour in
turn, a little at a time, stirring steadily;
bake in two layer-tins. Put jam between
them and on top.</p>

<p>Tiny field strawberries make the most
delicious shortcake of all.</p>

<h4>LEMON CHEESE CAKES</h4>

<p>¾ lb. of loaf sugar.<br>
4 oz. of fresh butter.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span><br>
Yolks of 6 eggs.<br>
Whites of 4 eggs.<br>
Peel of 3 lemons grated.<br>
Juice of 3 lemons.</p>

<p>Put the lemon juice and grated rind,
together with the sugar and butter, into
a brass pan; add the eggs gradually
lest they curdle. Then simmer over
the fire until as thick as honey, stirring
gently all the time.</p>

<p>Pour into small jars, and when cold
paste paper over. Keep in a very dry
place. Fill the patty-pans half-full, as
it rises much in a quick oven. Puff
paste should be used for these.</p>

<h4>LEMON JELLY</h4>

<p>½ box gelatine.<br>
½ cup cold water.<br>
2 cups boiling water.<br>
1 cup sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>Juice of 3 lemons, and three scrapings
of the yellow rind.</p>

<p>Put the gelatine into the cold water
and soak one hour. Put the boiling
water, the sugar, and the scrapings of
peel on the fire, and stir till the sugar
dissolves. Take it off the fire and stir
in the gelatine, and mix till this is dissolved;
when it is partly cool, turn in
the lemon juice and strain through a
flannel bag dipped in water and wrung
dry. Put into a pretty mould.</p>

<h4>ORANGE JELLY</h4>

<p>Make this exactly as you did the
Lemon Jelly, only instead of taking the
juice of three lemons, take the juice of
two oranges and one lemon, and scrape
the orange peel instead of the lemon
peel.</p>

<p>Whipped cream is nicer with either
of these jellies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span></p>

<h4>PRUNE JELLY</h4>

<p>Wash well a cup of prunes, and cover
them with cold water and soak overnight.
In the morning put them on
the fire in the same water, and simmer
till so tender that the stones will slip
out. Cut each prune in two and sprinkle
with sugar as you lay them in the
mould; pour over them lemon jelly
made by the recipe above, and put on
ice. Turn out on a pretty dish, and put
whipped cream round.</p>

<h4>FRUIT JELLY</h4>

<p>Make a plain lemon jelly, as before.
Cut up, very thin, two oranges, one
banana, six figs, and a handful of white
grapes, which you have seeded, and
sweeten them. Put in a mould and
pour in the jelly; as it begins to grow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>
firm you can gently lift the fruit from
the bottom once or twice.</p>

<p>You can also fill the mould quite full
of fruit, and make only half the jelly
and pour over. Whipped cream is nice
to eat with this.</p>

<h4>STEWED RHUBARB</h4>

<p>Wipe the rhubarb with a damp cloth.
Cut into pieces about one inch long;
put in a stewpan with enough water
just to cover it, and put in sugar to
suit taste. Cook till it becomes soft,
but not mashed; let it simmer gently.</p>

<h4>SNOW PUDDING</h4>

<p>½ box of gelatine.<br>
1 pint of cold water.<br>
3 eggs.<br>
Juice of 3 lemons.<br>
½ cup of powdered sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>Pour the water over the gelatine and
let it stand ten minutes; then put the
bowl over the fire and stir till it is dissolved,
and take it off at once. As
soon as it seems nearly cold, beat to a
froth with the egg-beater. Beat the
whites of the eggs stiffly, and add to the
gelatine, with the lemon juice and
sugar, and mix well. Put in a mould
and set on ice. Make a soft custard by
the recipe, and pour round the pudding
when you serve it.</p>

<h4>VELVET CREAM</h4>

<p>¼ box of gelatine.<br>
1 pint of milk.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
3 tablespoonfuls of sugar.<br>
Small teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Put the gelatine in the milk and soak
fifteen minutes; put on the stove and
heat till it steams, but do not let it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>
boil; stir carefully often, as there is
danger of its burning. Beat the yolks
of the eggs with the sugar, and put
these in the custard, and cook till it all
thickens and is smooth, but do not boil
it. Strain, cool, and add the vanilla,
and last fold in the beaten whites of
the eggs, and put in a mould on the ice.</p>

<p>Preserved peaches laid round this
are very nice, or rich pineapple, or
apricot jam; or a ring of whipped
cream, with bits of red jelly, make a
pretty border.</p>

<h4>COMPOTE OF ORANGES AND CHESTNUTS</h4>

<p>Peel and quarter eight oranges, boil
half-pound of lump sugar and half-pint
of water till it becomes a syrup. Pour
over quartered oranges whilst boiling,
and let cool. Boil one and a half or
two pounds of chestnuts until quite
cooked; peel and put into a boiling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
syrup, made as above, well flavoured
with vanilla. Gently simmer for one
and a half hours; when cool pass through
a wire sieve. Pile up in centre of dish
and place orange round; decorate with
whipped cream and pistachio nuts
(chopped).</p>

<h4>CREAM BUNS OR ÉCLAIRS</h4>

<p>½ pint water.<br>
1 oz. butter<br>
5 oz. fine flour.<br>
3 eggs.<br>
A little salt.</p>

<p>Put the water and butter in a saucepan
over the fire to boil, then stir in
five ounces of flour. Blend thoroughly
till smooth and well cooked; break in
the eggs and mix well together. Put
the mixture out in pieces on a well-buttered
baking-sheet and bake in a
slow oven for one hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>Scoop out the inside and fill with
whipped cream. Place the top on
again and sift sugar over, or they can
be covered with chocolate icing.</p>

<h4>TREACLE SPONGE</h4>

<p>½ lb. flour.<br>
¼ lb. beef suet.<br>
½ teaspoonful carbonate soda.<br>
A pinch of salt.<br>
1 teaspoonful ground ginger.<br>
1 teacup golden syrup.<br>
¼ pint milk.</p>

<p>Chop suet fine, put into a basin, add
flour, soda, and ginger; mix syrup with
the milk, stir this in the mixture; grease
a mould and steam two hours.</p>

<p>Froth Sauce can be served round, or
a little warmed golden syrup.</p>

<h4>HARD SAUCE</h4>

<p>Beat together a half-cup of powdered
sugar and a half-cup of butter with a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
fork till both are light and creamy.
Flavour with a teaspoonful of vanilla
and put on the ice to harden.</p>

<h4>FOAMY SAUCE</h4>

<p>½ cup butter.<br>
½ cup boiling water.<br>
1 cup powdered sugar.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.<br>
White of 1 egg.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a
cream; add vanilla and beat well.
When it is time to serve, beat the egg
stiff, stir the boiling water into the
sugar and butter, and then put in the
egg and beat till foamy, standing it on
the stove as you do so to keep it hot.
Serve in the sauce-boat.</p>

<h4>CHRISTMAS PUDDING</h4>

<p>4 lbs. of raisins.<br>
4 lbs. of currants.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span><br>
4 lbs. of mixed peel.<br>
4 lbs. of beef suet.<br>
2 lbs. of bread-crumbs.<br>
2 lbs. of flour.<br>
½ lb. of mixed spice.<br>
3 lbs. of brown sugar.<br>
16 or 20 eggs.<br>
2 lbs. of chopped sweet almonds.<br>
Rind of 4 lemons grated, and the juice.</p>

<p>Stone the raisins, wash the currants,
chop the suet and peel, and put all
dry ingredients together and mix well.
Then add the whipped eggs and stir all
together for half an hour; then add
half a bottle of rum, half a bottle of
brandy, and the juice of the lemons.
Add spirits to taste; boil eight hours.
Enough for twelve puddings.</p>

<h4>FROTH SAUCE FOR PUDDINGS</h4>

<p>Take a clean stewpan, break in two
yolks of eggs, quarter-pint of cream, a
wineglass of sherry, and a little sugar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>Whisk well on the stove till it becomes
thick and frothy, but not to
curdle; then pour round the pudding.
This sauce must not be made till just
before it is wanted.</p>

<h4>LEMON SAUCE</h4>

<p>White of 1 egg.<br>
½ cup of powdered sugar.<br>
Juice of half a lemon.</p>

<p>Beat the egg, add the sugar and
lemon, and beat again.</p>

<h4>WHITE SAUCE</h4>

<p>1 tablespoonful cornflour.<br>
½ cup cold water.<br>
1 cup boiling water.<br>
½ cup powdered sugar.<br>
Pinch of salt.<br>
2 whites of eggs.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>Dissolve the cornflour in the cold
water, and then add the boiling water
and sugar and salt, and cook for fifteen
minutes, stirring all the time. Take
from the fire and fold in the stiffly
beaten egg-whites with the flavouring,
and beat till perfectly cold. Any
flavouring will do for this sauce; pistache
is very nice.</p>

<h4>QUICK PUDDING SAUCE</h4>

<p>1 egg.<br>
½ cup powdered sugar.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Put the egg in a bowl without separating
it and beat till very light; then
pour in the sugar very slowly, beating
all the time; add the vanilla and serve
at once.</p>

<p>This is a very nice sauce, and so
simple to make that Margaret learned
it among the first of her recipes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span></p>

<h4>FRENCH PANCAKES</h4>

<p>2 tablespoonfuls flour.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
1 oz. butter.<br>
½ pint milk.</p>

<p>Rub the butter into the flour, beat
the eggs, add the milk and mix all
together. Put in well-buttered tins or
saucers; bake twenty minutes in a
quick oven.</p>

<h4>ICE-CREAMS AND ICES</h4>

<p>Margaret had a little ice-cream freezer
which was all her own, and held only
enough for two little girls to eat at a
tea-party, and this she could pack
alone. When she made ice-cream for
all the family she had to use the larger
freezer, of course, and this cook
helped her pack. But the same recipe
was used for either the large one or the
small. First break up the ice in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
thick bag with a hammer until the
pieces are no larger than eggs, and all
about the same size. Then put two
big bowls of this into a tub or pail,
and add one bowl of coarse salt, and
so on, till you have enough, mixing
it well with a long-handled spoon. Put
the freezer in its pail and put the cover
on; then fill the space between with
the ice and salt till it is full, pressing it
down as you work. Let it stand now
in a cool place, till you know the inside
is very cold, and then wipe off the top
carefully and pour in the cream, which
must be very cold, too. Put on the
top and turn smoothly and slowly till
it is stiff, which should be fifteen minutes.
Then draw off the water from
the pail, wipe the top of the cover again,
so that no salt can get in, and take out
the dasher, pushing the cream down with
a spoon from the sides and packing it
firmly. Put a cork in the hole in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>
cover, and put it on tightly. Mix more
ice with a little salt—only a cupful to
two bowls this time—and pack the
freezer again up to the top. Wring out
a heavy cloth in the salt water you
drew off the pail, and cover it over tightly
with this, and then stand in a cool, dark
place till you need it; all ice-creams are
better for standing two hours.</p>

<h4>QUEEN’S PUDDING</h4>

<p>1 breakfast-cup of bread-crumbs.<br>
3 oz. of castor sugar.<br>
1 rind of a lemon grated.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
1 breakfast-cup of milk.<br>
2 oz. of butter.</p>

<p>Put bread-crumbs into a basin with
lemon rind and sugar; warm the butter
in the milk, separate yolks from whites,
add the yolks when beaten to the milk
and butter, and pour over the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
ingredients. Grease a pie-dish and put
in mixture and bake until set. Leave
till it is cold, spread over it raspberry
jam, whip the whites to a stiff froth
with a little sugar, pile high on the top
and put it in the oven to dry, but not
to brown.</p>

<h4>PLAIN ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>3 cups of cream.<br>
1 cup of milk.<br>
1 small cup of sugar.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of vanilla.</p>

<p>Put the cream, milk, and sugar on
the fire, and stir till the sugar dissolves
and the cream just wrinkles on top; do
not let it boil. Take it off, beat it till
it is cold, add the vanilla, and freeze.</p>

<h4>FRENCH ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>1 pint of milk.<br>
1 cup of cream.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span><br>
1 cup of sugar.<br>
4 eggs.<br>
1 tablespoonful of vanilla.<br>
1 saltspoonful of salt.</p>

<p>Put the milk on the fire and let it just
scald or wrinkle. Beat the yolks of the
eggs, put in the sugar, and beat again;
then pour the hot milk into these
slowly, and the salt, and put it on the
fire in the double boiler and let it cook
to a nice thick cream. (This is a plain
boiled custard, such as you made for
Floating Island.) Take it off and let it
cool while you beat the whites of the
eggs stiff, and then the cup of cream.
Put the eggs in first lightly when the
custard is entirely cold, and then the
whipped cream last, and the vanilla,
and freeze.</p>

<h4>SUMMER PUDDING</h4>

<p>Line a pudding-basin with slices of
bread without crust, and cut out a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
round for the bottom. Fill up with
ripe raspberries or black currants, which
have been stewed a little with sugar to
make the syrup, but not long enough to
destroy the colour. Put a plate on the
top and a weight on it.</p>

<p>Next day turn out when required,
and serve with whipped or plain cream.</p>

<h4>COFFEE ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>Make either of these creams, and
flavour with half a cup of strong coffee
in place of vanilla.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>Make plain ice-cream; melt two
squares of chocolate in a little saucepan.
Mix a little of the milk or cream with
this, and stir it smooth, and then put it
in with the rest. You will need to use
a large cup of sugar instead of a small
one in making this, as the chocolate is
not sweetened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span></p>

<h4>PEACH ICE-CREAM</h4>

<p>Peel, cut up, and mash a cup of
peaches. Make plain ice-cream, with a
large cup of sugar, and when it is cold
stir in the peaches and freeze.</p>

<p>When Margaret wanted to make her
own freezer full of ice-cream, she just
took a cup of cream and heated it with
the sugar, and when it was cold put in
three drops of vanilla, and froze it.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">CAKE</h3>

<p>Next after the ices in her book, Margaret
found the cake to eat with them,
and first of all there was a recipe for
some little cakes which the smallest
girl in the neighbourhood used to make
all alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span></p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE ICING FOR CAKES</h4>

<p>Whites of 2 eggs.<br>
¼ pound icing sugar.<br>
3 oz. grated chocolate.</p>

<p>Melt the chocolate in a stewpan
with a tablespoonful of milk, and mix
it with the sugar. When cool, stir in
the whites, which have been well beaten,
and use.</p>

<h4>ELEANOR’S CAKES</h4>

<p>¼ cup of butter.<br>
½ cup of sugar.<br>
¼ cup of milk.<br>
1 egg.<br>
1 cup of flour.<br>
1 teaspoonful of baking-powder.<br>
½ teaspoonful of vanilla.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a cream,
beat the egg light without separating,
and put it in next; then the milk, a
little at a time; mix the baking-powder
with the flour and stir in, and last the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
vanilla. Bake in small scalloped tins,
and fill each one only half-full.</p>

<h4>GRANDMOTHER’S LITTLE FEATHER CAKE</h4>

<p>1 cup sugar.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls soft butter.<br>
1 egg.<br>
½ cup milk and water mixed.<br>
1½ cups sifted flour.<br>
1 teaspoonful baking-powder.</p>

<p>Rub the butter and sugar to a cream.
Beat the yolk of the egg stiff and put
that in; then add part of the milk and
water, and part of the flour and baking-powder,
which has been sifted together;
next the vanilla, and last the stiff
whites of the eggs, not stirred in, but
just lightly folded in. If you put them
in heavily and roughly, the cake will
always be heavy. Bake this in a
buttered biscuit-tin, and cut in squares
when cold. It is nice covered with
caramel or chocolate icing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span></p>

<h4>DOMINO CAKE</h4>

<p>Make this feather cake and pour it
into two pans, so that the bottom shall
be just covered, and bake it quickly.
When it is done, take it out of the pans
and ice it, and while the icing is still
a little soft, mark it off into dominoes.
When it is entirely cold, cut these out,
and with a clean paint-brush paint
little round spots on them with a little
melted chocolate, to exactly represent
the real dominoes. It is fun to play a
game with these at a tea-party, and eat
them up afterwards.</p>

<h4>MARGARET’S OWN CAKE</h4>

<p>Margaret’s mother named this cake
for her, because she liked so much to
make it and to eat it. It is very nice
cake for little girls.</p>

<p>5 eggs.<br>
1 cup of granulated sugar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span><br>
1 cup of flour.<br>
1 pinch of salt.<br>
½ teaspoonful of lemon juice, or vanilla.</p>

<p>Separate the eggs, and beat the yolks
very light and foamy; then put in the
sugar, which you have sifted, a little at
a time, and the flour in the same way;
but put them in in turn—first sugar,
then flour, and so on. Then put in the
flavouring, and last fold in the whites
of the eggs, beaten very stiff. Bake in
a buttered pan.</p>

<h4>SPONGE CAKE</h4>

<p>Take four eggs, their weight in castor
sugar, and the weight of two in flour.</p>

<p>Separate the yolks from the whites.
Beat the yolks lightly, gradually add
sugar, then add the whites, which have
been beaten stiffly, and lastly the flour
and a few drops of essence of lemon.</p>

<p>Bake in a moderate oven for one
hour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span></p>

<h4>BRANDY SNAPS</h4>

Little juice of lemon.</p>

<p>The butter and the treacle to be
made warm in the oven; then put the
sugar and flour, ground ginger and
lemon to it, and stir till smooth.</p>

<p>Spread very thin on the baking-sheet.
When done, take off in squares; let them
get a little cool, and then roll them round
the handle of a wooden spoon; don’t let
them get too stiff or they will not roll.</p>

<h4>LAYER CAKE</h4>

<p>1 cup sugar.<br>
½ cup water.<br>
2 eggs.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls baking-powder.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span><br>
½ cup butter.<br>
2½ cups flour.<br>
Teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Rub the butter to a cream in a deep
bowl, and put in the sugar a little at a
time, and rub this till it, too, creams.
Then put in the beaten yolks of the eggs,
and then the water. Beat the egg-whites
well, and fold in half, then add
the flour, in which you have mixed and
sifted the baking-powder, and then put
in the vanilla and the rest of the eggs.</p>

<p>Divide in two layers, or in three if
the tins are small, and bake till a light
brown.</p>

<h4>DANISH CAKES</h4>

<p>5 oz. flour.<br>
¼ lb. butter.<br>
2 oz. brown sugar.<br>
A few drops of vanilla.<br>
1 egg.<br>
1 oz. cocoanut.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>Rub butter in flour, add sugar and
vanilla, mix with yolk of egg, roll out
and cut out with round cutter, brush
tops over with the white of egg, sprinkle
over with cocoanut, and bake in moderate
oven about quarter of an hour.</p>

<h4>COCOANUT CAKES</h4>

<p>¼ lb. cocoanut.<br>
Whites of 2 eggs.<br>
2 oz. castor sugar.</p>

<p>Beat whites to a stiff froth, then add
the sugar and cocoanut, drop on a
greased tin, and bake in a quick oven.</p>

<h4>DUNDEE CAKE</h4>

<p>Cream together six ounces of butter
and six ounces of castor sugar; well
whisk four eggs.</p>

<p>Sieve together eight ounces of flour
with half-teaspoonful of baking-powder,
add to the flour the grated rind of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
one lemon. Next add the eggs and
flour alternately to the butter and
sugar; stir in well; mix together quarter-pound
currants, quarter-pound sultanas,
three ounces chopped peel, and one
ounce shredded almonds. Add these
to the other ingredients, mixing well.
Put mixture into a lined tin, sprinkle
almonds on the top, and bake one and
a half hours.</p>

<h4>JOU CAKE</h4>

<p>6 oz. of butter.<br>
½ lb. of castor sugar.<br>
¾ lb. of flour.<br>
4 eggs.<br>
Cup of milk.<br>
¼ lb. of sultanas.<br>
¼ lb. of glacé cherries, cut in half.<br>
2 oz. of citron.<br>
A little essence of vanilla.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.</p>

<p>First prepare a deep Yorkshire pudding-tin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
grease it well, and line it
with white paper, and cut. Make it
fit the tin; then grease the inside paper
well and dust over with sugar. Put
the butter into a deep basin and beat
well to a cream, then add the sugar and
work that in well, then the eggs, one at
a time, and beat thoroughly. Add the
fruit and the essence, mix the baking-powder
with the flour, and stir in gradually
to the other ingredients; lastly, stir
in a teacupful of milk and pour into the
tin, and bake three-quarters of an hour
without opening the oven door if possible.
If the oven is very hot, put some
paper over the top to prevent it getting
too brown. The cake can be cut up
into any shapes, as it is two and a half
inches high when cut.</p>

<h4>A NICE RICH CAKE</h4>

<p>¾ lb. butter.<br>
½ lb. Demerara sugar.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span><br>
½ lb. flour.<br>
6 eggs.<br>
1 lb. currants.<br>
1 lb. sultanas.<br>
½ lb. candied peel.<br>
¼ lb. sweet almonds, blanched and sliced.<br>
½ teaspoonful mixed spice.<br>
¼ pint rum or brandy.</p>

<p>Beat butter to a cream; then add
sugar and beat well; next the eggs
(which must have been well beaten for
twenty minutes), then the fruit, peel,
and spice. Add the rum and then the
flour. Beat all well together; bake in
a lined tin, with buttered paper, in a
moderate oven three and half hours.</p>

<h4>QUEEN CAKES</h4>

<p>The weight of two eggs in flour, sugar,
and butter. Beat butter to a cream,
add the sugar, and well work that in.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[155]</span>
Next, add one egg—allow five minutes
for each egg—then the other, and lastly
the flour, in which has been put half-teaspoonful
of baking-powder. Stir
lightly, add a few cleaned currants, and
half fill the moulds. These must be
prepared before you begin the mixture.
Bake in a moderate oven a quarter of
an hour or twenty minutes; let them
stand a few minutes when done, and
turn out on a wire sieve. It is sufficient
for twelve or fourteen cakes.</p>

<h4>SHORTBREAD</h4>

<p>½ lb. flour.<br>
5 oz. butter.<br>
3 oz. sugar.</p>

<p>Put in a basin and knead all well
together; roll out and cut out with
plain or fancy cutters. Bake in a
quick oven a quarter of an hour. They
must not be baked brown.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span></p>

<h4>NOAH’S BUN</h4>

<p>1 lb. flour.<br>
½ lb. Demerara sugar.<br>
½ lb. sultanas.<br>
¼ lb. currants.<br>
1 teaspoonful ground ginger.<br>
1 teaspoonful mixed spice.<br>
1 dessertspoonful carbonate of soda.<br>
6 oz. butter, warmed in a breakfast-cup of milk.</p>

<p>Stir the butter and milk into the other
ingredients with a wooden spoon, and
bake in a buttered and lined tin two
hours; it is a very dark cake.</p>

<h4>A NICE CHOCOLATE CAKE</h4>

<p>½ lb. butter.<br>
2 oz. ground rice.<br>
½ lb. grated chocolate.<br>
¼ lb. flour.<br>
6 oz. castor sugar.<br>
1 teaspoonful baking-powder.<br>
4 eggs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span><br>
A few drops essence of vanilla.</p>

<p>Beat butter and sugar together for
twenty minutes, add the chocolate—previously
dissolved in a tablespoonful of
milk, not too hot—add yolks one at a
time, mixing each carefully. Mix flour,
rice, and powder together, and sift
through a sieve to the yolks, and stir
gently. Beat whites to a stiff broth,
stir in lightly, add the essence, and bake
in a papered tin in a good oven an hour
and half. The oven door must not be
opened, at least, for half an hour, and
closed gently. Try with an iron skewer
at the end of one and a half hours.</p>

<h4>SWISS ROLL</h4>

<p>3 eggs.<br>
6 oz. of castor sugar.<br>
Grated rind of half a lemon.<br>
4 oz. of flour.<br>
½ teaspoonful of baking-powder.
</p>

<p>Put yolks and sugar into a basin,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
whip together for twenty minutes, mix
lemon peel and flour gradually. Whip
whites to a stiff froth and mix in lightly.
Turn the mixture into a well-greased
tin, bake twenty minutes in quick oven.
Have ready a sheet of paper, well
sprinkled with castor; turn the cake
on to this; spread two tablespoonfuls
of warm raspberry jam, then roll up as
lightly as possible, and put on a sieve to
cool.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">FILLING FOR LAYER CAKES</h3>

<h4>NUT AND RAISIN FILLING</h4>

<p>Use the recipe for plain icing, and
add a half-cup of chopped raisins mixed
with a half-cup of chopped almonds or
English walnuts.</p>

<h4>FIG FILLING</h4>

<p>Mix a cup of chopped figs with the
same icing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span></p>

<h4>ORANGE FILLING</h4>

<p>1 cup powdered sugar.<br>
1 tablespoonful boiling water.<br>
Grated rind of 1 orange.<br>
1 tablespoonful orange juice.</p>

<p>Put the sugar in a bowl, add the rind,
then the water and juice, and spread
at once on the cake. This icing must
be very thick when made, and if it
seems thin put in more sugar.</p>

<h4>CARAMEL FILLING</h4>

<p>2 cups brown sugar.<br>
½ cup cream or milk.<br>
Butter the size of an egg.<br>
½ teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Mix all together and cook till it is
smooth and thick.</p>

<h4>EASY FRUIT-CAKE</h4>

<p>Margaret’s Other Aunt begged to
have this in the book, because she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
it was so simple any little girl could
make it, and all the family could help
eat it, as they were especially fond of
fruit-cake.</p>

<p>1 cup butter.<br>
2 cups sugar.<br>
1 cup milk.<br>
1 cup currants.<br>
1 cup raisins.<br>
1 egg.<br>
1 teaspoonful soda.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls mixed spices.<br>
3 cups flour.</p>

<p>Wash and dry the currants. Buy
the seeded raisins and wash these,
too, and then chop them. Cream the
butter and sugar, add the egg, beaten
well without separating, then the
sugar with the soda stirred in it, then
the milk, then the spice. Measure the
flour, and then take out a half-cup of
it, and stir in the raisins and currants,
to keep them from going to the bottom<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
of the cake when it is baked. Stir
these in, add the rest of the flour and
beat well. Bake in two buttered cake-tins.</p>

<h4>PLAIN ICING</h4>

<p>Put the white of one egg into a bowl
with a half-teaspoonful of water, and
beat till light. Then stir in a cup of
sifted powdered sugar, and put on the
cake while that is still warm, and smooth
it over with a wet knife.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE ICING</h4>

<p>Melt one square of chocolate in a
saucer over the tea-kettle, and put in
two tablespoonfuls of milk and stir till
smooth. Add two tablespoonfuls of
sugar and a small half-teaspoonful of
butter, and stir again. Take it off the
stove and put it on the cake while both
are warm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span></p>

<h4>CARAMEL ICING</h4>

<p>½ cup milk.<br>
2 cups brown sugar.<br>
Butter the size of an egg.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Mix the butter, sugar, and milk, and
cook till it is smooth and thick, stirring
all the time and watching it carefully to
see that it does not burn; take it off
and put in the vanilla, and spread while
warm on a warm cake.</p>

<h4>DOUGHNUTS</h4>

<p>Margaret’s mother did not approve
of putting this recipe in her cook-book,
because she did not want Margaret ever
to eat rich things; but her grandmother
said it really must go in, for once in a
while very nice doughnuts would not
hurt anybody.</p>

<p>1½ cups of sugar.<br>
½ cup of butter.<br>
3 eggs.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span><br>
1½ cups of milk.<br>
2 teaspoonfuls of baking-powder.<br>
Pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Put in flour enough to make a very
soft dough, just as soft as you can
handle it. Mix, and put on a slightly
floured board and make into round balls,
or roll out and cut with a cutter with
a hole in the centre. Take two cups
of lard with one cup of beef suet which
you have melted and strained, and heat
till it browns a bit of bread instantly.
Then drop in three doughnuts—not
more, or you will chill the fat—and
when you take them out dry on brown
paper. It is much better to use part
suet than all lard, yet that will do if
you have no suet in the house.</p>

<h4>TEA CAKES</h4>

<p>2 squares of chocolate.<br>
1 teaspoonful of sugar.<br>
Bit of butter the size of a pea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>Melt the chocolate over the fire and
stir in the sugar and butter and a couple
of drops of vanilla, if you like. Take
little round biscuits, and with a fork
roll them quickly in this till they are
covered; dry on buttered paper.</p>

<h4>BREAD SAUCE FOR CHICKEN, TURKEY,
AND GAME</h4>

<p>Put into a saucepan the quantity of
milk you think will be required. Put
some stale bread through the wire sieve
and put the crumbs into the milk—not a
great deal at first, as the bread swells.
Also put a small onion, with four cloves
stuck in it, into the milk. Let it gently
simmer until the bread swells, but if
not fairly thick add more crumbs. Before
serving take out the onion and
add salt and pepper and a lump of
butter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span></p>

<h4>BROWN SAUCE FOR FISH</h4>

<p>One ounce of butter into a stewpan.
Stir in a spoonful of flour (or more if a
large quantity is required). Let these
cook together for five minutes, then add
some well-seasoned stock and stir till
it boils; colour with some gravy colouring;
add salt to taste. Add a glass of
port or sherry, one teaspoonful of anchovy
sauce, same of Worcester sauce,
a little chopped parsley and mushrooms.
Just before serving add a little lemon
juice—about a teaspoonful; if it is put
in at first it will turn the parsley brown.</p>

<h4>COLD BRANDY SAUCE FOR PLUM PUDDING</h4>

<p>4 oz. of butter.<br>
4 oz. of castor sugar.<br>
4 tablespoonfuls of brandy.</p>

<p>Beat butter to the thickness of honey,
mix in the sugar and pour in the brandy
by degrees, and see that all is well mixed.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span></p>

<h3 class="nobreak">TARTS</h3>

<p>Margaret’s mother did not like her to
eat tarts, but she let her learn how to
make them, and once in a while she had
a small piece. Here is her recipe:</p>

<p>1 lb. of flour.<br>
¼ lb. of butter.<br>
¼ lb. of lard.<br>
1 teaspoonful of salt.<br>
½ cup of water.</p>

<p>Put the flour, butter, lard, and salt
in a bowl, and rub well in. Then add
the water, a little at a time, turning the
paste and mixing till smooth, but not
touching with the hand. Put a very
little flour on the pastry-board and lift
the crust on this, and with a floured
rolling-pin lightly roll it out once each
way; fold it over and roll again, and
do this several times till the crust looks
even, with no lumps of butter showing
anywhere. Put it on a plate and lay<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
it in the ice-chest for at least an hour
before you use it.</p>

<p>Pie-crust will never be light and nice
if you handle it. Do not touch it with
your fingers unless it is really necessary.
When you use it, get everything ready for
the pie first, and then bring out the crust,
roll quickly, and spread over the pie.</p>

<p>Put a narrow strip of paste all round
the edge, and press it together; if you
wet it with a little water it will stick.</p>

<p>Put on the cover, wet the edges so
they will stick together, and pinch
evenly.</p>

<h4>APPLE TART</h4>

<p>Fill a baking-dish with apples, peeled
and cut in slices. Sprinkle cinnamon
and plenty of sugar, about half a cup.
Put in the oven and bake till the apples
are soft, and then cool, put on the
crust, and bake till brown. Serve powdered
sugar and rich cream with this.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span></p>

<h4>FRENCH PEACH PIE</h4>

<p>Put the crust in the pie-dish as before;
boil a cup of sugar with two
tablespoonfuls of water till it thickens.
Lay quarters of peaches in the paste,
round and round, evenly, no one on
top of the other. Break ten peach-stones
and arrange the kernels evenly on
top; then pour the syrup over, and put
a few narrow strips of crust across the
pie, four each way, and bake.</p>

<h4>CRANBERRY PIE</h4>

<p>Cook a quart of cranberries till tender,
with a small cup of water; when they
have simmered till rather thick, put in
a heaped cup of sugar and cook five
minutes more. When as thick as oatmeal,
take them off the fire and put
through the colander; line a tin with
crust, fill with the berries, put strips of
crust across, and bake. A nice plan is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
to take half a cup of raisins and a cup
of cranberries for a pie, chopping together
and cooking with water as before,
adding a sprinkling of flour and a
little vanilla when done.</p>

<h4>TARTLETS</h4>

<p>Whenever Margaret made a tart she
always saved all the bits of crust and
rolled them out, and lined patty-pans
with them and baked them. She often
filled them with raw rice while they
baked, to keep them in shape, saving
the rice when they were done. She
filled the shells with jelly, and used the
tartlets for lunch.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<h3 class="nobreak">CANDY</h3>

<p>Margaret did not wait till she reached
the recipes for candy at the back of her
book before she began to make it. She<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
made it all the way along, whenever
another little girl came to spend the
afternoon, or it was such a rainy day
that she could not go out. Nearly always
she made sugar candy, because it
was such fun to pull it, and she used the
same recipe her mother used when she
was a little girl.</p>

<h4>SUGAR CANDY</h4>

<p>2 cups brown sugar.<br>
1 cup white sugar.<br>
1 tablespoonful butter.<br>
1 tablespoonful vinegar.<br>
1 small teaspoonful soda.</p>

<p>Boil hard twenty minutes, stirring all
the time, and cool in shallow pans. If
you double the quantity you must boil
the candy five minutes longer.</p>

<p>The best thing about this candy is
that it does not stick to the fingers, if
you let it get quite cool before touching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[171]</span>
it, and pull it in small quantities. Do
not put any butter on your fingers, but
work fast.</p>

<h4>HARDBAKE</h4>

<p>Make the sugar candy given above,
and stir in a large cup of shelled almonds
just before taking it from the fire. Put
in shallow, buttered pans.</p>

<h4>PEPPERMINT DROPS</h4>

<p>1 cup of sugar.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of water.<br>
3 teaspoonfuls of peppermint essence.</p>

<p>Boil the sugar and water till when
you drop a little in water it will make
a firm ball in your fingers. Then take
it off the fire and stir in the peppermint,
and carefully drop four drops, one exactly
on top of another, on a buttered
platter. Do not put these too near together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span></p>

<h4>CREAM WALNUTS</h4>

<p>2 cups of light brown sugar.<br>
⅔ cup of boiling water.<br>
1 small saltspoonful of cream of tartar.<br>
1 cup of chopped walnuts.</p>

<p>Boil till the syrup makes a thread, then
cool till it begins to thicken, and stir in
the walnuts and drop on buttered paper.</p>

<h4>CREAM MADE FROM ICING SUGAR</h4>

<p>Take the white of one egg, and
measure just as much cold water; mix
the two well, and stir stiff with icing
sugar; add a little flavouring, vanilla,
or almond, or pistache, and, for some
candies, colour with a tiny speck of
fruit paste. This is the beginning of all
sorts of cream candy.</p>

<h4>CHOCOLATE CREAMS</h4>

<p>Make the cream candy into balls,
melt three squares of chocolate; put a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
ball on a little skewer or a fork, and dip
into the chocolate and lay on buttered
paper.</p>

<h4>NUT CANDY</h4>

<p>Chop a cup of almonds and mix with
the cream candy; make into bars, and
when cold cut in slices.</p>

<h4>WALNUT CREAMS</h4>

<p>Press two walnut halves on small
balls of cream candy, one on either side.</p>

<h4>BUTTERSCOTCH</h4>

<p>6 tablespoonfuls of brown sugar.<br>
2 tablespoonfuls of water.<br>
1 tablespoonful of butter.<br>
1 saltspoonful of soda.</p>

<p>Boil all together, without stirring, till
it hardens in water; then put in a small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
teaspoonful of vanilla and pour at once
on a buttered dish. When hard break
up into squares.</p>

<h4>PINOCHE</h4>

<p>1 cup light brown sugar.<br>
1 cup cream.<br>
1 cup walnuts, chopped fine.<br>
Butter the size of a walnut.<br>
1 teaspoonful vanilla.</p>

<p>Cook the sugar and cream till it
makes a ball in water; then put in the
butter, vanilla, and nuts, and beat till
creamy and spread on a dish.</p>

<h4>BETTY’S ORANGE CANDY</h4>

<p>Betty was Margaret’s particular
friend, so this was her favourite recipe:</p>

<p>2 cups sugar.<br>
Juice of one orange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>Boil till it hardens in water, and then
pull it.</p>

<h4>CREAMED DATES, FIGS, AND CHERRIES</h4>

<p>Make the plain cream candy, as before;
wash the dates well, open at one
side, and take out the stones and press
in a ball of the candy; leave the side
open. You can sprinkle with granulated
sugar if you choose.</p>

<p>Cut figs in small pieces, and roll each
piece in the cream candy till it is hidden.</p>

<p>For the cherries, colour the cream
candy light pink and make into little
balls. On top of each press a candied
cherry.</p>

<h4>DATES WITH NUTS</h4>

<p>Wash and wipe the dates dry, and
take out the stones. Put half an English
walnut in each and press the edges
together; roll in granulated sugar. Small
figs may be prepared in the same way.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak">MARGARET’S SCHOOL
LUNCHEONS</h3>

<p>As Margaret had to take her luncheon
to school with her sometimes, she had
to learn how to make a good many
kinds of sandwiches, because she soon
grew tired of one or two sorts.</p>

<p>&#160;</p>

<p>Cut the bread very thin and spread
lightly with butter, and after they are
done trim off the crusts neatly, not
taking off all the crust, but making the
two pieces even. For plain meat sandwiches,
chop the meat very fine, sprinkle
with salt, and spread on the bread; if
it is too dry, put in a very little cream
as you chop the meat.</p>

<h4>EGG SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Make a very little French dressing—about
a teaspoonful of oil, a sprinkling
of salt, and four drops of lemon juice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
or vinegar. Chop a hard-boiled egg
very fine, mix with the dressing, and
spread.</p>

<h4>LETTUCE SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Spread the bread, lay on a lettuce-leaf,
and cover with French dressing,
or with mayonnaise. These sandwiches
are about the best for school, as they
do not get dry.</p>

<h4>CELERY SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Chop the celery fine, mix with a
French or mayonnaise dressing, and
spread.</p>

<h4>CHICKEN AND CELERY SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Mix chopped celery and chopped
chicken, as much of one as the other,
wet with French or mayonnaise dressing,
and spread.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span></p>

<h4>SARDINE SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Scrape off all the skin from the sardines,
and take out the bones and drain
them by laying them on paper; mash
them with a fork, and sprinkle with
lemon juice, and spread.</p>

<h4>TOMATO AND CHEESE SANDWICHES</h4>

<p>Slice a small, firm tomato very thin
indeed, and take out all the seeds and
soft pulp, leaving only the firm part;
put one slice on the bread, and one thin
shaving of cheese over it, and then put
on bread. A slice of tomato with a
spreading of mayonnaise makes a nice
sandwich.</p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this

prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
        distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works.
    </div>
</div>

from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
